For a given number of overlapping live\nranges, the graph shows the percentage of execution time\nspent in functions with fewer overlapping live ranges. As is\nshown in the graph, for most benchmarks more than 70% of\nthe execution time is spent in functions with fewer than 100\nsecurity registers live. Future work on additional compiler\noptimizations to reduce register live ranges may have the\npotential eliminate register spill and fill code, and therefore\nto significantly boost the performance of the system.\nThe execution speed of the secured programs, relative\nto the base is shown in Figure 7.
