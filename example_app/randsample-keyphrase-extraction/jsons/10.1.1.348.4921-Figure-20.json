We ignore\nthe predicate and context columns, and treat the dataset as a graph\nwhere each unique string that appears as either a subject or an ob-\nject is a node, and each 〈subject, object〉 tuple as an edge. The\nfiltered Triples dataset is 120GB in size.\nFreebase is another real-world dataset7, where a large amount of\nconcepts are connected by various relationships. If we search for\na keyword or concept ID on the Freebase website, it returns the\ndescription of a matched concept, as well as outgoing links to the\nconnected concepts. Therefore, we filter the Freebase raw dataset\n(which is the crawl of the whole Freebase website) to extract tuples\nof the form of 〈concept id1, concept id2〉. The filtered Freebase\ndataset (12.2GB in total) is actually a concept-connection graph,\nwhere each unique concept id is a node and each tuple represents\nan edge. Detailed data set statistics are in Figure 20.\nWe run PageRank on the Livejournal and Freebase datasets be-\ncause ranking on social network and crawl graphs makes sense in\npractice. Similarly, we run the descendant query on the Livejournal\nand Triples datasets. In the social network application, a descen-\ndant query finds one\u2019s friend network, while for the RDF triples,\nsuch a query finds a subject\u2019s impacted scope. The initial source\nnode in the query is chosen at random.\nBy default, experiments on Livejournal are run on a 50-node\ncluster, while experiments for both Triples and Freebase are exe-\ncuted on a 90-node cluster.\n"],"Page":12,"Number":20,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[155,145,325,158],"Height":1169,"Width":827,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[90,73,392,136]}
