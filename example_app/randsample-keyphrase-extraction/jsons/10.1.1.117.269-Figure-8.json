{"Caption":"Figure 8: Brokering of 140 machines from two sites between a low-priority computational batch cluster and a high-priority e- commerce website that are competing for machines. Where there is contention for machines, the high priority website receives its demand causing the batch cluster to receive less. Short lease terms (a) are able to closely track resource demands, while long lease terms (b) are unable to match short spikes in demand.
