The ex-\nperiment begins with the slice\/user requesting for a vBTS\ncreation. In response, the vBTS aggregate manager creates\nan appropriate VM instance, sets up networking from the\nVM to the vlan, and returns the status of the operation. If\nthe vBTS creation is successful, the slice requests for addi-\ntion of a wireless WiMAX client to its instance by specifying\nits MAC address. The vBTS aggregate manager sends this\ninformation to the RF aggregate manager that populates an\nentry in a mapping table. Typically, the ﬁelds in this table\nare: vlan− id, vm−name, client−MAC, client−gre, and\ngre direction. Out of these, the ﬁrst three entries are pro-\nvided by the vBTS aggregate manager. The client−MAC\nto gre mapping information is made available by the NEC\nmodiﬁed ASN controller to the RF aggregate manager on the\nASN substrate. In the mapping table, the client−MAC is\nused to uniquely identify every entry. When all entries are\npopulated in a row of the mapping table, an end to end data\npath is automatically setup in Click [1] 5.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,327,407,384],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[93,72,388,299]}
