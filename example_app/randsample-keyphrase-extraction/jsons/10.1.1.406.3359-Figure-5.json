Execution cost vs. n over \nuniform database \n","In this section, we vary the number of data items in each list, i.e. \nn, and investigate its effect on execution cost. Figure 15 shows \nhow execution cost increases over the uniform database with \nincreasing n up to 200,000, and with the other parameters set as in \nTable 1. Increasing n has a considerable impact on the \nperformance of the three algorithms over a uniform database. The \nreason is that when we enlarge the lists and generate uniform \nrandom data for them, the top-k data items are distributed over \nhigher positions in the list. \n"],"Page":9,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[534,341,742,368],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[538,125,747,330]}
