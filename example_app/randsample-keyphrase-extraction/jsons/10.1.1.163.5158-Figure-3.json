{"Caption":"Figure 3: Performance characteristics of four different VAT disks. All the numbers are in seconds. The first column shows the VAT boot times on an IBM Thinkpad T42p, from the time BIOS transfers control to the VAT\u2019s boot block to the VAT being fully up and running. In all cases the BIOS takes an additional 8 seconds initializing the system before transferring control to the VAT. The rest of the table shows results for the micro-benchmarks run with fully-primed caches when run over a 100 Mbps network.

The results, shown in the first column of\nFigure 3 indicate that the VAT boot process is reasonably\nfast across different types of drives we tried.\nFor our second test, we run the same micro-benchmark\nworkloads as above; to emphasize disk performance\nrather than network performance, the VMs are fully\nprefetched into the cache, and the machines are connected\nover a 100Mbps LAN. The results are shown in Figure 3.\nThe flash drive performs well on this workload, because\nof its good read performance with zero seek time, but\nhas limited capacity, which would prevent it from running\nlarger applications well.
