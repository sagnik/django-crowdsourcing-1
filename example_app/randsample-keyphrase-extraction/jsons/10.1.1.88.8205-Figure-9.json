{"Caption":"Figure 9. MCSM for SIS modeling: Industrial test-case demonstrate the true benefit of our model, we enabled MIS in ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["We have implemented an MCSM delay engine in our STA \nframework which also has extensive circuit simulation capabilities. \nWe analyzed a medium-sized industrial microprocessor block \n(~20K cells, 65 nm static CMOS) with extracted interconnect and \ncell netlists. For each delay arc, we simulated the stage using a \ntransistor-level simulator. We propagated the complete piece-wise \nlinear waveforms from stage to stage. Delays were measured from \ndriver inputs to receiver inputs and slews were measured at receiver \ninputs. The input waveforms for both MCSM and transistor-level \nanalysis came from transistor-level simulations (for an \u2018apples-to-\napples\u2019 comparison on every stage). Figure 9 shows a comparison \nof delay errors for SIS situations. The histograms show that MCSM \nperforms well for SIS on a realistic test-case as well. \n"],"Page":5,"Number":9,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[91,831,409,869],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[74,573,409,832]}
