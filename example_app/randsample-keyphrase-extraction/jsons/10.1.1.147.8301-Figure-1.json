Animal detections using 1-shot models.","ImageText":[],"Mention":["bined images from the Mammal Images Benchmark [15],\nthe Corel data base, INRIA Horses [18], and additional\nimages from the web. Images show quadrupeds roughly\npose-aligned, but at varying scales, and contain consider-\nable background clutter (see Fig. 1). While all quadrupeds\nshare a common topology (head, neck, torso, and four legs),\nthey vary significantly in the concrete embodiment, leading\nto variations in both the appearance of individual body parts\nas well as their spatial layout. In addition, we use the swan,\nmug, and bottle classes from the ETHZ Shape Classes data\nset in Sect. 5.2 for partial knowledge transfer.\n"],"Page":1,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[468,505,716,518],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[427,295,759,502]}
