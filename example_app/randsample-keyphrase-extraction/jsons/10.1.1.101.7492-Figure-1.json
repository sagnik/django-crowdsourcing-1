This approach, which is \nillustrated in Figure 1, is described in the following steps. \nStep 1: Legacy system evaluation. This evaluation \nreveals the current status of a legacy system and specifies \nwhich phase it is in its lifecycle. A decision tree is used in \nthe assessment in order to consider many aspects \naltogether. Techniques such as the Options Analysis for \nReengineering (OAR) are used to guide the decision-\nmaking process. Reengineering decisions are made \naccording to this assessment. \nStep 2: Architecture recovery. The goal of this step is \nto obtain design and architecture information as much as \npossible by reverse engineering techniques. The static and \ndynamic analysis techniques applied in this step will \ndepend on the features of the legacy system. Various \nmodularization criteria, such as coupling, cohesion, \nreliability, maintenance measures, are adopted to identify \npotential components and connectors. The results are the \nfoundation of further reengineering work and the input of \nlater service identification. \nStep 3: Service identification. On the one hand, it is to \ndetermine what business functionalities should be \nprovided by the target service in the application domain. \nOn the other hand, the business functionalities embedded \nin the legacy system should be identified in order to be \nreused in the target service.  \n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[465,777,775,818],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[445,537,776,772]}
