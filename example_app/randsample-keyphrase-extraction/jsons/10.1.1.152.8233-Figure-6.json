a direct comparison to the results in [19], we used\nonly 11 actions as shown in Figure 4, but unlike them we\nreport results on four views instead of the three best. In this\nfirst experiment, after the initial 4D-AFM is built, learning\nis performed by using other views. In each round of test-\ning, an action sketch extracted from a single view video is\ninput into the system. An action label is then provided by\ncomputing the scores of matching the action sketch to the\nlearned 4D-AFM. The action recognition results using sin-\ngle view videos for each action class from each camera are\nshown in figure 5. In our experiment, for actions like \u2018get\nup\u2019 and \u2019walk\u2019, the recognition results are consistently high.\nThis we believe is due to their distinctness regardless of the\nview. On the average the recognition rates are 72%, 53%,\n68%, 63% for camera 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.\nAs compared to the accuracy reported in [19] (55%,\n64%, 60% for cameras 1, 2 and 4 respectively), our per-\nformance is better except for camera 2. There are two chief\nreasons for this. Firstly, the spatiotemporal information is\nfully exploited in our work thanks to the 4D action shape\nsequence and the attached spatiotemporal action features.\nWhile in the work of [19], only the temporal sequential\ninformation between the 3D exemplars is considered for\nrecognizing actions. Secondly, action sketches from differ-\nent views are integrated in the 4D-AFM in a unified man-\nner, which makes the computation of matches between the\nmodel points and the action features in test video from an\narbitrary view very efficient. In figure 6, we show the con-\nfusion matrix for the different actions averaged over all the\nsingle views.\n","able. We have tested using all four views as well as combi-\nnations of three and two views. In figure 7, we show recog-\nnition results of using the camera combinations \u20181234\u2019,\n\u2018123\u2019, \u201813\u2019, and \u201824\u2019. The average recognition results for\nthese combinations are summarized in Table 1. It can\nbe seen that the recognition performance can be improved\nwhen multi-view videos are available, which are compara-\nble to the results present in [19].\nIt is interesting to see that when all the 4 views are used,\nall the instances of the actions of \u2018scratching head\u2019, \u2018turn-\ning around\u2019, and \u2018walking\u2019 can be recognized in our exper-\niment. The main reason is that the action features of these\nactions are quite discriminative. For example, the STV of\n\u2018scratching head\u2019 is significantly different from other ac-\ntions, which results in the distinction of the action fea-\ntures extracted from the STV. Another possible cause of\nthis could be that the 4D-AFMs of these actions contain\ndominating action features, which lead to high recognition\naccuracy of these actions with the price of increased false\npositives, as suggested by the 7th column of the confusion\nmatrix in Figure 6.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[68,516,398,545],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[100,312,364,512]}
