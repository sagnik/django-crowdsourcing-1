{"Caption":"Figure 2: System Prototype. Our system consists of an array of small, low-cost, low-power ultrasonic sources and detectors (microphones) placed on the body (left). The ultrasonic sources (top-middle) sequentially emit ultrasonic pulses, which are received by the microphones (bottom-middle) and processed to yield distance measurements for all source-microphone pairs. To increase precision and the sampling rate, as well as to alleviate visibility problems, each sensor board is also equipped with a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer that measure rotation rates and linear accelerations respectively (bottom-middle). The data collection is managed by a small driver box (right) using a laptop hard disk for storage; both the driver box and the laptop are carried by the user in a backpack.

As illustrated in Figure 2, our system is con-\ntrolled by a custom-built driver box connected to a laptop using a\nUSB interface. The driver box is also connected to eight ultrasonic\nsources and eighteen sensor boards using shielded 3-wire cables.\nAll sensors are attached to the user\u2019s garment. The driver box pro-\nvides pulse signals to the ultrasonic sources, polls data from the\nsensors, and provides power to the sensor boards. The driver box is\npowered by a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery pack with 4.4 AHr\ncapacity, which provides several hours of safe operation (the current\ndrawn by our system is 1.5A). A laptop records the data on a hard\ndrive but is not used for any processing. We envision a commercial\nsystem that replaces the driver box and laptop, both of which are\ncurrently carried in a backpack, with a single iPod-sized unit.\n","Therefore, our signal sources employ off-the-shelf piezoelectric\ntransducers (Figure 2 top-center) to emit pulses at ultrasonic fre-\nquencies (40 kHz). They are mounted onto small plastic plates,\nattached to the garment, and wired to the pulse-generating driver\nbox. The pulses are detected by conventional audio microphones\n(Figure 2, bottom-center). Although they do not exhibit optimal re-\nsponse in the 40 kHz range, they are able to clearly detect our ultra-\nsonic pulses while offering several advantages over ultrasonic de-\ntectors: they are small in size (2.5mm3); they have a wide-angle re-\nsponse \u2014 there is no need for accurate alignment with the sources;\nand they have a wide bandwidth \u2014 we do not need to tune them\nto the exact frequency of the ultrasonic source. We arranged the\nultrasonic sources such that they see most of the microphones most\nof the time: seven sources around the chest and belly pointing for-\nward, with the eighth source on the brim of a hat pointing down\n(Figure 2, left).\n","In addition to the microphone, each sensor board (Figure 2, bottom-\ncenter) is equipped with a 3-axis rotation rate sensing unit (the\ngyroscope), and a 3-axis linear acceleration sensing unit (the ac-\ncelerometer). Their measurements enhance the precision and frame\nrate of the ultrasonic components. Furthermore, they alleviate the\nline-of-sight problems associated with acoustic signals. An on-\nboard micro-controller collects the inertial data, combines it with\nthe acoustic signal, and sends it to the driver box.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,334,775,416],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[73,75,774,312]}
