{"Caption":"Figure 1. The System Framework","ImageText":[],"Mention":[" Different from their contributions, we propose a new \nmethodology in supporting uncertainty modelling and rea-\nsoning in a single ontology, as well as ontology mapping \nusing Bayesian networks. As can be seen from Figure 1 \nabove, the system includes four components: 1) a learner to \nobtain probabilistic ontological information and raw map-\npings using data obtained from web; 2) a representation \nmechanism for the learned uncertain information concern-\ning the entities and relations in given ontologies; 3) a Baye-\nsOWL (Ding, Peng, and Pan 2004; Ding and Peng 2004) \nmodule to translate given ontologies (together with the \nlearned uncertain information) into BNs; and 4) a concept \nmapping module which takes a set of learned raw similari-\nties as input and finds mappings between concepts from \ntwo different ontologies based on evidential reasoning \nacross two BNs. The ideas about these four components, as \nwell as their related works, are presented in the next four \nsections respectively. The paper ends with a discussion and \nsuggestions for future research. \n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[155,445,325,458],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[76,231,408,431]}
