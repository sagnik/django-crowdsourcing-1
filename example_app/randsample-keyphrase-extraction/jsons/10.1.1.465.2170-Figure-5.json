SUD-\nUML, our modified version of UML, is also based on\nUbuntu\u2019s Linux 2.6.30-5 kernel.\nOur current prototypes of SUD and SUD-UML include\nproxy drivers and UML support for Ethernet cards, wire-\nless cards, sound cards, and USB host controllers and\ndevices. On top of this, we have been able to run a\nrange of device drivers as untrusted user-space processes,\nincluding the e1000e Gigabit Ethernet card driver, the\niwlagn5000 802.11 wireless card driver, the ne2k-pci Eth-\nernet card driver, the snd hda intel sound card driver, the\nEHCI and UHCI USB host controller drivers, and various\nUSB device drivers, all with no modifications to the driver\nitself.\nFigure 5 summarizes the lines of code necessary to\nimplement the base SUD system, the base SUD-UML\nenvironment, and to add each class of devices. The USB\nhost driver class requires no code beyond what is provided\nby the SUD core. Some USB devices, however, require\nadditional driver classes. For example, a USB 802.11\nwireless adapter can use the existing wireless proxy driver,\nand a USB sound card could use the audio card proxy\ndriver. We are working on a block device proxy driver to\nsupport USB storage devices.\n"],"Page":10,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,224,414,275],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[112,98,400,219]}
