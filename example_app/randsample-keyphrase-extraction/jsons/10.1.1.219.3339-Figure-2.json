A very similar distribution appears for both train\nlines: the vast majority of travellers use the train only a few\ntimes during the sample, with around 70% of users being\nunique (i.e., they are seen in the system only once). Most\nimportantly for us, a substantial subset of people frequently\ncommute in and out of the city, and are seen between 20-40\ntimes over the duration of the sample.\nTo gain a more precise idea of how regular passenger travel\ntimes are, we have analysed the occurrence of journeys over\nthe time of day. The most regular user behaviour would\ninvolve travelling at the same time every day, and the least\nregular would never travel at a similar time on any day. We\ndefine a regularity metric for a particular user\u2019s journey as\nthe number of their other journeys that occurred within 10\nminutes of its entry time. A user\u2019s overall regularity measure\nis then defined as their average journey regularity. Figure 2\ndepicts the number of users with a given regularity value; the\nthree curves show the regularity results for all users, users\nthat travel more than five times and users that travel more\nthan 10 times in the sample. The number of users obtaining\nlow regularity scores decreases significantly as the minimum\nnumber of journey threshold is increased, while the number\nof high scoring users stays constant. This confirms that the\nmore frequently travelling hosts are also the ones having\nmore regular journey times.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[478,343,733,356],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[462,100,760,310]}
