to each of the metrics from section 3. We conclude\nthe following from Figure 3: (1) Even if we examine other\nmetrics beyond EntropyTS, DCOP algorithms do not suffer\nfrom privacy loss to the extent seen in the earlier investiga-\ntion [Maheswaran et al.2005], further confirming the posi-\ntive results seen earlier. (2) The choice of metric affects how\nthe algorithms compare to the centralized approach (with\nLinearS suggesting the most privacy loss), but seems to pre-\nserve the qualitative ranking of the algorithms.\nMAX method: Figure 4 shows the results for all the al-\ngorithms aggregated by the MAX method for all seven sce-\nnarios, with T = 3. The number of valuations is plotted on\nthe x-axis and the privacy loss is plotted on the y-axis. The\nMAX method shows that there is always a privacy benefit\nobtained by using DCOP algorithms, even those that, by the\nAVERAGE methode (and any of the six metrics) perform\nworse than the centralized approach, if the major privacy\nconcern is one agent accumulating too much knowledge.\nUnder the MAX method, DPOP and ADOPT continued to\noutperform SynchBB, while SynchID varied widely.\n","We calculated upper bounds on privacy loss for one of the\nmost promising DCOP algorithms: DPOP. We used a brute\nforce approach which generated all possible combinations\nof input valuations, ran DPOP on them to generate a trace\nof the messages each combination would produce and then\nfor each agent matched these up to the messages that were\nactually received. We performed simulations of this type for\nDPOP, which took several days to run, compared to the sev-\neral hours taken by our primary inference algorithms. Re-\nsults for upper and lower bound inference for DPOP using\nall six metrics are shown in Figure 5. Scenarios 1, 4, and\n5 are shown for three timeslots and three valuations, with\nthe metric plotted on the y-axis and the privacy loss plotted\non the x-axis. Due to asynchrony and the randomness in a\nvariable\u2019s initial choice of value, it is not possible to analyze\nADOPT with this approach.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[442,855,775,888],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[445,399,769,841]}
