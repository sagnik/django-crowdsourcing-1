This is a much more demanding computation,\nrequiring a conjugate-gradient search in a 257-dimensional\nspace (as opposed to 2-dimensional) and requires far more\ncputime. To appreciate the added burden, soft-ARD re-\nquired approximately 4 minutes of cputime for the Laplace-\nGPC and 21 minutes for the EP-GPC (independently of\nk). We contrast this with the mere 2 seconds required by\nGSLDA for all k. There is also the added concern of hav-\ning more local optima in the marginal likelihood with this\nmany hyperparameters and an increased risk of over-\u0002tting.\nThe saliency (relevance) of individual pixels can be visu-\nalized by displaying the inverse-lengthscales in image for-\nmat as in Figure 10(c) and (d), for Laplace and EP GPCs, re-\nspectively. Although not easy to interpret, there does appear\nto be more relevance associated with pixels near the upper\nright-hand cusp of the digit \u00945\u0094 (where it differs markedly\nfrom \u00943\u0094). By comparison, we show the corresponding\nloadings (absolute-value elements) of the Fisher discrimi-\nnant (LDA eigenvector) in Figure 10(e) which bears a re-\nsemblance to the relevance maps in (c) and (d). Note that\nranking the elements of this eigenvector was how we ob-\ntained the pixels-sets for Fisher thresholding in Figure 7.\nUsing the soft-ARD relevance maps in (c) and (d), we\ncan also rank pixels according to inverse-lengthscales to\nform subsets of various size k. But this turns out not to\nyield the best performance (same as with Fisher threshold-\ning, to be presented shortly). In fact, visual inspection of\nthe relevance maps in Figure 10(c)-(e) might lead us to con-\nclude that the upper-right cusp (gap) of the digit \u00935\u0094 is in\n"],"Page":6,"Number":7,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[68,254,398,304],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[133,99,317,254]}
