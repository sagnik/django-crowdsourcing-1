We see this difference regardless of the\nnumber of votes a resolve received. The comparison of seed\nvote percentage shows a statistically significant, if moder-\nate, network effect. Because the networks are rather dense,\nwith highly active users also having many network connec-\ntions, the subnetwork of voters on a given resolve quickly\npercolated throughout the overall network. That is, a giant\nconnected component of voters formed in the real data and\nthe randomization tests, after only a few votes. Indeed, the\nreal data and the randomization tests had statistically indis-\ntinguishable percentage of voters in the giant component for\nresolves with more than 50 votes. This result highlights the\nimportance of high-degree nodes in the process of spreading\nnew content, no matter what the mechanism.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,288,406,365],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[107,84,370,264]}
