In Fig.12, we plot\nthe ratios of all four metrics measured (i.e, totals in the\n400-second period) from the AURORA and BASELINE ex-\nperiments to that of CTRL. For example, when injected with\nthe same `Web' data stream, Fig. 12A shows that AURORA\nrendered 205 times more total delay violations than CTRL\nand BASELINE had 23 times. Similar results were obtained\nin total delayed tuples (Fig. 12B) and maximal overshoot\n(Fig. 12C). Note that all data points for CTRL are 1.0 in\nFig. 12. The data loss ratio for all methods are almost\nthe same with AURORA losing slightly fewer tuples (0.986\nfor `Web' and 0.987 for `Pareto'). It is easy to see that,\nfor both real (`Web') and synthetic (`Pareto') data inputs,\nCTRL is the easy winner in the three delay-related metrics\nwith almost the same amount of data loss. The BASELINE\nmethod, as a feedback solution, has worse performance than\nCTRL but it also beats AURORA.\nTo better understand the above long-term results, we show\nthe transient performance of all three methods by plotting\ny(k) values measured at all control periods in Fig. 15. We\ncan see that, as expected, almost all output in CTRL is\nvery close to the target value of two seconds. For BASE-\nLINE and AURORA, we can observe peaks that are large in\nboth height and width. Such peaks are the results of either\n\ructuations of arrival rate or changes of c (e.g., those at\nabout 50th second and 125th second, and the high terrace\nstarting from the 230th second). Note the \frst two peaks of\nc also have impact on the CTRL system: average delay in-\ncreases beyond two seconds. However, with the design goal\n","of fast convergence and high damping, the controller in the\nCTRL system can quickly bring the system back to a stable\nstate thus large peaks of y are avoided. The high terrace\nhas almost no e\u000Bect on CTRL. This is because the value\nof c increases gradually before the terrace. Our controller\ncan capture and compensate for this kind of gradual change\nwhile the open-loop system cannot (i.e., Example 2 in Sec-\ntion 4.3.1). From Fig. 15, we can fairly conclude that the\ndesign goal of our controller (Section 4.4.1) is achieved.\n"],"Page":10,"Number":15,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,385,407,414],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[74,78,402,382]}
