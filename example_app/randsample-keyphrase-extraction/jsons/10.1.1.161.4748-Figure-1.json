first approach we consider for exploiting the opponent is to directly estimate the\nparameters of their strategy and play a best response to that strategy. We start with a\nprior over the opponent\u2019s strategy and compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP) esti-\nmate of those parameters given our observations. This is a form of Bayesian parameter\nestimation, a typical approach to learning and therefore a natural choice for our study.\nIn general poker games a hand either results in a showdown, in which case the\nopponent\u2019s cards are observed, or a fold, which leaves the opponent\u2019s cards uncertain\n(we only get to observe their actions, our own cards, and any public cards). However,\nin Kuhn poker, the small deck and dominated strategies conspire in certain cases to\nmake the opponent\u2019s cards obvious despite their folding. For example, if P1 holds\nthe Jack and observes the sequence bet\u2014pass, we can conclude that P2 must hold the\nQueen. Examination of Figure 1 shows that if P2 holds the King, then passing on a bet\nwould be a dominated strategy. Because we have precluded dominated strategies, we\ncan therefore conclude that P2 holds the Queen despite never seeing it. Thus, certain\nfolding observations (but not all) contain as much information as a showdown.\n","easily be derived by examination of the tree in Figure 1. In this case, there is a\n","to the \u201Csafe\u201D strategy. While the opponent modelling algorithms have been seen to do\nwell on average, how often is the attempt to exploit a losing proposition? We attempt\nto answer this question by plotting the proportion of trials in which the opponent mod-\neller\u2019s total winnings equal or exceed the expected total winnings for playing a Nash\nstrategy, versus the switching hand. This proportion is the frequency with which the\nattempt to exploit at least did not hurt us, and possibly was beneficial. It gives some\nnotion of how damaging the variance can be.
