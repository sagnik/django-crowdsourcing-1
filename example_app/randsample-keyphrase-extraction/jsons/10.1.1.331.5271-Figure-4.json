FEM versus CG FEM. The accompanying video pro-\nvides comparisons of CG and DG for 3D elasticity, on coarse\nand more detailed simulation meshes. However, a qualitative\ncomparison between the two methods is generally hard. We\ntherefore also quantitatively compare CG to DG, the latter\nusing BZ\/IP penalties and linear\/quadratic basis functions,\nbased on a 2D Poisson problem with analytically known so-\nlution (cf. Fig. 4). In addition, Table 1 gives some statistics\nand timings of the same five methods for 3D linear elasticity.\nNote that even for the same mesh and basis functions DG\nprovides more degrees of freedom (DOFs) than CG, since\nnodes can \u201Csplit\u201D due to discontinuous displacements. The\nplots and timings are therefore with respect to DOFs.\n","For the same number of DOFs and basis functions of the\nsame degree, CG FEM can be observed to be more accurate\nthan DG FEM by a constant factor (Fig. 4) and to be slightly\nmore efficient (Table 1). Since standard CG FEM is also eas-\nier to implement, it will stay the preferred method for many\napplications. However, as soon as topological changes of the\nsimulation mesh are required or if complex element shapes\nhave to be simulated, the higher flexibility of DG FEM pays\noff, as for instance in the following examples.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,415,731,462],"Height":1169,"Width":827,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[120,116,700,404]}
