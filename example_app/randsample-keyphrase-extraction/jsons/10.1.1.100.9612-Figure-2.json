{"Caption":"Figure 2: A comparison between TRON (blue solid line) and SV M perf (red dotted line). The y-axis shows the accuracy differences between current models and that of using the stopping tolerance 0.1. The x-axis (training time) is in seconds. We use C = 1. One must be careful that SV M perf \u2019s C parameter is different. We take our C value and set SV M perf \u2019s C parameter as Cl\/100.
