{"Caption":"Figure 5: Additional examples of memorability maps generated by our algorithm.","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Memorability maps: We obtain memorability maps using max-pooling of the α from different\nimage regions. Fig. 4 shows the memorability maps obtained when using different features and\nthe overall memorability map when combining multiple features. Despite using no annotation, the\nlearned maps are similar to those obtained using ground truth objects and segments. From the\nimages shown, we observe that there is no single attribute that is always effective at producing\nmemorability maps, but the combination of the attributes leads to a significantly improved version.\nWe show additional results in Fig. 5.\n","Further, we analyze the image region types by computing the standard deviation of the memorability\nscores of the image regions that correspond to the particular type. Fig. 6(b) and 6(c) show the\nresults. The results are encouraging as regions that have high standard deviation tend to have a value\nof α close to 0.5, which means they are not very informative for prediction. The same behavior is\nobserved for multiple feature types, and we find that the overall performance for individual features\n(shown in Fig. 6(a)) corresponds well with the distance of the peaks in Fig. 6(b) from α = 0.5. This\nsuggests that our algorithm is effective at learning the regions with high and low probability of being\nforgotten as proposed in our framework.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[197,753,651,767],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[148,540,702,749]}
