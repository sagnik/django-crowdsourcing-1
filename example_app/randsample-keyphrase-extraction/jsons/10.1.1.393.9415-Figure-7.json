","ImageText":[],"Mention":["The main contribution of this paper is the concept of rapid \nprototyping of 3D objects using a laser cutter, so as not to \nrequire manual assembly. As illustrated by Figure 7, our \napproach is substantially faster than traditional 3D fabrica-\ntion techniques such as 3D printing and unlike traditional \nlaser cutting, the resulting 3D objects require no manual \nassembly. \n","Creating a suspender creates a hole in the workpiece\u2014one \nof the limitations of our approach. However, the approach \noffers freedom in \u201Crouting\u201D the suspenders, which allows \nus to place them so as to minimize interference with the \nremaining workpiece (Figure 17). \n"],"Page":3,"Number":7,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[441,458,773,523],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[440,299,777,456]}
