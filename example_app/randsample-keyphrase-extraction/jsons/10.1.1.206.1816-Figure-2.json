{"Caption":"Figure 2: Topic representing the peanut butter recall from January 18, 2009, with the size of a word proportional to its importance in the topic. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["For example, if we define our features based on a 50-topic LDA model trained on an eight hour\ndata set from January 18, the topic with the lowest weight is about the peanut butter recall, a\nmajor news story at this time (cf. Figure 2). Thus, if we select fifteen posts following the na¨ıve LDA\napproach, we do not pick a post from this topic. However, the weight of this topic (0.019) is not\nmuch lower than the mean topic weight (0.020). Moreover, since this topic closely corresponds to a\nprevalent news story, many posts cover it with high probability. TDN selects such a post because,\nunlike the na¨ıve LDA approach, it simultaneously considers both the topic weights and the post\ncoverage probabilities.\n"],"Page":14,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[123,277,725,309],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[251,136,595,256]}
