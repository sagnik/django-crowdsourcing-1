In\nthe presence of sybil nodes, the probability that an honest verifier\nV accepts another honest suspect S decreases. First, the routes\nfrom S may enter the sybil region, and the adversary can prevent\nthese routes from intersecting with V \u2019s routes. The same is true\nfor V \u2019s routes. Second, the presence of sybil nodes necessitates\nthe technique of majority voting as in Section 4.4. This means that\namong the d routes from V , at least d\/2 routes need to successfully\naccept S before V can accept S.\nTo capture the worst case scenario, here we will assume that\nafter a route (from V or S) enters the sybil region, the rest of the\nroute can no longer be used for verification\/intersection. In some\nsense, the presence of sybil nodes \u201Cprunes\u201D the routes. As in Sec-\ntion 6.1, we assume that a \u201Cpruned\u201D route from V accepts S if it has\nat least 10 distinct intersections with S\u2019s \u201Cpruned\u201D routes. Finally, V\nsuccessfully accepts S if a majority of V \u2019s routes accept S.\nFigure 12 presents the probability of V accepting S, as a function\nof the number of attack edges g. This probability is still 99.8% with\n2500 attack edges, which is quite satisfactory. The case without\nusing redundancy is much worse (even if we seek only a single\nintersection), demonstrating that exploiting redundancy is necessary.\nFor our 10000-node topology and 100-node topology, g= 204 and\ng= 11 give probabilities of 99.6% and 87.7%, respectively. Notice\nthat a 87.7% probability does not mean that 12.3% of the nodes will\nnot be accepted by the system. It only means that given a verifier,\n12.3% of the nodes will not be accepted by that verifier. Each honest\nnode, on average, should still be accepted by 87.7% of the honest\nnodes (verifiers).\n"],"Page":11,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,226,774,288],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[471,86,743,217]}
