For example, if the user fre-\nquently changes the print quality setting (which requires 4\nto 6 mouse clicks to access in a typical print dialog box),\nSUPPLE will copy that functionality to the adaptive part of\nthe main print dialog box (Figure 5, left).\nOur decision-theoretic approach also allows SUPPLE to\nadapt to a person\u2019s long term usage patterns.
