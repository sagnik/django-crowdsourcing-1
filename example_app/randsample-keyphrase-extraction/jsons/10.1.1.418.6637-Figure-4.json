","ImageText":[],"Mention":["To alleviate these abrupt position corrections, we would like to\n\u201Csmooth out\u201D the hierarchy changes, so that they occur over some\ntime interval, rather than suddenly. However, since the changes to\nthe hierarchy are combinatorial, this is problematic. Our solution\nis essentially to let the various mesh pyramids nearby the current\nframe \u201Cvote\u201D on the result of a particular signal processing oper-\nation. When processing frame i, we take all the pyramids from\nframes j within a certain window around frame i, and signal pro-\ncess the geometry of frame i with each of them. We then average\nthe resulting vertex positions (See Figure 4). It is vital to note,\nhowever, that we are not averaging the result of applying pyramid\nj to geometry j, for j 6= i, and averaging with the other frames in\nthe window. Doing that would smooth out the original geometry\nmotion, which is quite undesirable. Instead, we are only diffusing\n"],"Page":4,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,220,408,261],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[135,73,358,198]}
