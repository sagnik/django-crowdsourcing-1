{"Caption":"Figure 5. Some results from the PASCAL 2007 dataset. Each row shows detections using a model for a specific class (Person, Bottle, Car, Sofa, Bicycle, Horse). The first three columns show correct detections while the last column shows false positives. Our system is able to detect objects over a wide range of scales (such as the cars) and poses (such as the horses). The system can also detect partially occluded objects such as a person behind a bush. Note how the false detections are often quite reasonable, for example detecting a bus with the car model, a bicycle sign with the bicycle model, or a dog with the horse model. In general the part filters represent meaningful object parts that are well localized in each detection such as the head in the person model. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Our system performs well on rigid objects such as cars\nand sofas as well as highly deformable objects such as per-\nsons and horses. We also note that our system is successful\nwhen given a large or small amount of training data. There\nare roughly 4700 positive training examples in the person\ncategory but only 250 in the sofa category. Figure 4 shows\nsome of the models we learned. Figure 5 shows some ex-\nample detections.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[68,898,757,987],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[67,99,759,896]}
