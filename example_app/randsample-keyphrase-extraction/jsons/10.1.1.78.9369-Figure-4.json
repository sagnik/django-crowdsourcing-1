Neither\nf the cases is desirable. Short distances between hops im-\nly a high number of hops in the path. On the other hand,\nhen a hop length is close to a maximum coverage range,\nhe connection can be easily lost if one of the nodes moves\nut of the range, or slightly changed interference jams the\neak signal.\nMoreover, poor connection quality leads to throughput\negradation, due to an increased number of errors. If an\ndaptive data-rate is used, then a high bit error rate forces\nhe data-rate to decrease, and this step may lead to a bot-\nleneck problem in the current node.\nAnother factor that seriously limits the performance of\nd hoc networks is the \u201Chidden terminal\u201D problem. Using\nTS\/CTS handshake, node A \u201Csecures\u201D the transmission of\ndata packet to node B. However, only the nodes that are\nithin the receiving range from node A and B adjust their\nAV (Network Allocation Vector) not to interfere with the\nata transmission from A to B. Other nodes just perform\nhe carrier sense step, and whenever the medium is free may\ntart a transmission. If then the signal to noise ratio reaches\nome threshold (e.g., 10 dB) in node B, then A\u2019s transmis-\nion fails. The weaker the signal from A in node B, the easier\nt is that the communication Aâˆ’B can be interrupted by a\nidden terminal.\nPGB addresses all of the above cases by allowing only cer-\nain nodes to rebroadcast a route request. This restriction\nignificantly limits the set of possible intermediate nodes and\nn turn automatically reduces the routing load. PGB works\nn both cases: when the information about nodes coordi-\nates is available and when not.\nPGB classifies each node that receives a broadcast packet\ne.g., route request) into one of the three groups, based on\nhe sensed signal level (Figure 4):\n\u2022 Preferred group (PG) \u2013 the preferred set of nodes;\n\u2022 IN group \u2013 nodes with a signal stronger than in PG;\n\u2022 OUT group \u2013 nodes with a signal weaker than in PG.\n","ared to two values: Inner Threshold (IT ) and Outer Thresh-\nld (OT ).
