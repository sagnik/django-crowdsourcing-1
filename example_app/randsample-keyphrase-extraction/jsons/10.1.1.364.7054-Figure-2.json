{"Caption":"Figure 2. Information propagation using entity\u2019s synonyms,         antonyms, similar words and related words ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["To cover more language phenomenon and large domains, in the \ntraining step, we have employed a new technique to \nautomatically propagate information of each expert tagged \nentity to its synonyms, antonyms, similar words and related \nwords. Figure 2 illustrates an example. As mentioned above, an \nentity can be a single word or a phrase. By expanding each \nsingle word to a list of its related words, different word \ncombinations can be formed. In Figure 2, the sentence \u201CGood \npicture quality\u201D is an expert tagged opinion sentence. During \nthe training course, the system looks up synonyms and \nantonyms for opinion entities. The tag of the original opinion \nentity \u201Cgood\u201D, <OPINION_POS_EXP> (positive opinion), gets \npropagated to each synonym of \u201Cgood\u201D (red box on the left in \nFigure 2). The negative tag <OPINION_NEG_EXP> gets \npropagated to \u201Cgood\u201D\u2019s antonyms (dark red box on the bottom \nleft). Similarly, for each single word in other entity types, \nsimilar words and related words are looked up. The tag of the \noriginal word gets propagated to each newly discovered related \nword (blue boxes). Using this expansion, a number of bi-gram \ncombinations (green arrows) can be obtained. In this example, \nthere are several possible instances derived from \u201CGood picture \nquality\u201D, such as \u201CDecent picture quality\u201D, \u201CPoor image quality\u201D, \nand etc. \n"],"Page":4,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[451,380,771,408],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[456,138,771,370]}
