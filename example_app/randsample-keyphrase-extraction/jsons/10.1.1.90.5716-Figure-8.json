To probe this issue, we first consider a\nscenario where we assume that each ISP has an unknown\n(to us) objective, and randomly assign costs to each link\nfrom a finite range. The solid curves in Figure 8 show the\nresults. The left graph plots the CCDF of path inflation\nrelative to global, as computed in ยง 6.1.1. The right graph\nplots the individual gain for ISPs, measured as the aver-\nage reduction in cost of carrying traffic.
