{"Caption":"Figure 3: Results for Fuzzy and hierarchical cluster- ing (Agnes) on three different clustering thresholds for the second WePS testbed. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["training data: figures for threshold 1 outperform the other\ntwo for the Purity-Inverse Purity F-score, but are much\nworse than the others if we consider the BCubed F-score.\nThe Fuzzy Ants clustering, on the other hand, gives much\nbetter results than for the training data. This is probably\ndue to the fact that this data set is much more balanced and\nambiguous than the training set (See Section 5.1).\nThe results for both clustering approaches on the second\nWePS testbed are shown in Figure 3. The Fuzzy results\ncorrespond to the two first official runs for the WePS 2 com-\npetition (AUG 1 and AUG 2) that had slightly different set-\ntings, but almost identical results. The AUG 3, AUG 4 and\nAUG 5 runs correspond to the three Agnes submissions with\nvarying thresholds (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 respectively).\n"],"Page":5,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,902,772,944],"Height":1169,"Width":827,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[441,641,761,861]}
