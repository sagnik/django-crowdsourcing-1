Let the frame lie\nin the X-Y plane in the world coordinate system as shown in fig. 2. For simplicity, let us express the geometry in terms of\nan aspect ratio m and a shear η. Thus, the values in the paper are given by l = mh and s = ηh. The four 3D vertices (in\nhomogeneous coordinates) of the frame within this plane are given by\n"],"Page":2,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[276,327,572,339],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[292,107,559,302]}
