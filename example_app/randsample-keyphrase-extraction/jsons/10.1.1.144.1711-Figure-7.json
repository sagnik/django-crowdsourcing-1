In Figure 4(a) we see that 57.5%\nof opens in the corporate workload are to newly-created\nfiles or truncated files with zero size. However, this is not\nthe case in the engineeringworkload, where only 6.3% of\nopens are to zero-size files. Interestingly, both workloads\nfind that most opened files are small; 75% of opened\nfiles are smaller than 20KB. However, Figure 4(a) shows\nthat most bytes are transferred from much larger files. In\nboth workloads, we see that only about 60% of bytes are\ntransferred from files smaller than 10MB. The engineer-\ning distribution is also long-tailed with 12% of bytes be-\ning transferred from files larger than 5GB. By compari-\nson, almost all of the bytes transferred in previous studies\ncame from files smaller than 10MB. These observations\nsuggest that larger files play a more significant role in\nnetwork file system workloads than in those previously\nstudied. This may be due to frequent small file requests\nhitting the local client cache. Thus, file systems should\nstill optimize small file layout for frequent access and\nlarge file layout for large transfers. Observation 4 Bytes\nare transferred from much larger files than in previous\nstudies.\n","We now take a closer look at the properties of file I\/O,\nwhere, as defined in Section 4.1, an I\/O request is de-\nfined as any single read or write operation. We begin\nby looking at per-file, per-session I\/O inter-arrival times,\nwhich include network round-trip latency. Intervals are\ncategorized by the type of requests (read or write) that\nbracket the interval; the distribution of interval lengths\nis shown in Figure 7(a). We find that most inter-arrival\ntimes are between 100µs and 100ms. In fact, 96.4% and\n97.7% of all I\/Os have arrival times longer than 100µs\nand 91.6% and 92.4% are less than 100ms for corporate\nand engineering, respectively. This tight window means\nthat file systems may be able to make informed decisions\nabout when to prefetch or flush cache data. Interestingly,\nthere is little distinction between read-read or read-write\nand write-read or write-write inter-arrival times. Also,\n67.5% and 69.9% of I\/O requests have an inter-arrival\ntime of less than 3ms, which is shorter than some mea-\nsured disk response times [23]. These observations may\nindicate cache hits at the server or possibly asynchronous\nI\/O. It is also interesting that both workloads have simi-\nlar inter-arrival time distributions even though the hard-\nware they are running is of different classes, a mid-range\nmodel versus a high-end model.\n","Next, we examine the distribution of bytes transferred\nby a single I\/O request. As Figure 7(b) shows, most\nrequests transfer less than 8KB, despite a 64KB max-\nimum request size in CIFS. This distribution may vary\nbetween CIFS and NFS since each buffers and schedules\nI\/O differently. The distribution in Figure 7(b) increases\nfor only a few I\/O sizes, indicating that clients generally\nuse a few specific request sizes. This I\/O size informa-\ntion can be combined with I\/O inter-arrival times from\nFigure 7(a) to calculate a distribution of I\/Os per-second\n(IOPS) that may help file systems determine how much\nbuffer space is required to support various I\/O rates.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":7,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[436,533,751,589],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[443,102,754,513]}
