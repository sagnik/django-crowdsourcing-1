{"Caption":"Figure 4. Our videomicroscopy data is composed of a time-series of 24 image stacks acquired from a 2-photon microscope over a 1.5 hour period. Each stack contains 1024 × 1024 × 31 pixels, which corresponds to a 270 × 270 × 62 µm volume of the brain. The data contains over 1700 nucleus detections corresponding to 101 individual neurons. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["It is then possible to visualize the neurons migrating and\ndeveloping in their natural environment using two-photon\ntime lapse microscopy (Ultima microscope; Prairie Tech-\nnologies, Middleton, WI). The specimen is illuminated with\n900nm light from a tunable pulsed Ti:sapphire femtosec-\nond laser (Mai-TaiTM ; Spectra-Physics). Excitation light is\nfocused onto the specimen using a 40x, NA 0.8 water im-\nmersion objective (Olympus). Emitted light is collected in\nthe epifluorescence configuration through a 680nm long-\npass dichroic mirror and an infrared-blocking emission fil-\nter using a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu). Scanning\nand image acquisition were controlled using Prairieview\nsoftware. A time-series of image stacks, depicted in Fig. 4,\nis produced and then denoised [4] and stabilized [8].\nMigrating neurons move in a characteristic manner, de-\npicted in Fig. 5. The nucleus extends a neurite, at the end of\nwhich is a growth cone, which the neuron uses as an anchor\nto pull itself forward. Because neuron cell bodies are highly\ndeformable and irregular, they are difficult to track. For this\nreason, we perform tracking on the nucleus, which retains a\nmore consistent shape and can be readily detected.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[68,217,398,306],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[103,103,360,213]}
