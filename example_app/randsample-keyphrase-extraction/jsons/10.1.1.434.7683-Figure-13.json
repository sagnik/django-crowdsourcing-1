{"Caption":"Figure 13. Remote Collaboration: While one user is writing on their floor plan, the annotation can be transferred to a remote user\u2019s digital pen and hence projected for synchronization. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["The system supports illustrative communication between \nremote collaborators, such as a designer and a fabricator. \nWe briefly explored this scenario by introducing a second \nAnoto pen to our system, and printing out a second copy of \na floor plan. When annotations are made by one user with \nthe standard Anoto pen, they can be displayed in real time \nas virtual ink by the user of the PenLight system (Figure \n13). Annotations from the remote user are displayed in a \ndifferent color. We implemented this locally only, but in \npractice it could be implemented for remote scenarios by \nconnecting the pens over a network.  \n"],"Page":8,"Number":13,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,566,410,608],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[75,435,400,560]}
