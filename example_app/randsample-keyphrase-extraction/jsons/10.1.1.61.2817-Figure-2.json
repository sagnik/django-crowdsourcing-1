Data Offset measures the\noffset, in words, to the start of packet data. Since this field\nis 8 bits long, a DCCP header can contain more than 1000\nbytes of option. The Type field gives the type of packet,\nand is somewhat analogous to parts of the TCP flags field.\nThe names in Figure 1 correspond to packet types, of which\nDCCP specifies ten. Many packet types require additional in-\nformation after the generic header, but before options begin;\nthis design choice avoids cluttering the universal header with\ninfrequently-used fields. Even the acknowledgement number\nis optional, potentially reducing header overhead for unidi-\nrectional flows of data. There are no equivalents to TCP\u2019s\nreceive window and urgent pointer fields or its PUSH and\nURG flags, and TCP has no equivalent to CCVal (Section 6.2)\nor CsCov\/Checksum Coverage (Section 6.5). Sequence and\nacknowledgement numbers are 48 bits long, although some\npacket types also permit a compact form to be used (see Sec-\ntion 4.5).\n"],"Page":5,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[437,221,780,272],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[440,72,782,211]}
