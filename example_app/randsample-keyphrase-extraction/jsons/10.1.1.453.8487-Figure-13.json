{"Caption":"Figure 13: Detecting process exceptions.","ImageText":[],"Mention":["structures these exceptions for further processing by Mi-\ncrosoft Notification Services (MSNS).\nBefore alerts can be generated, rules must be defined\nbased on the model described in this paper. The Prote´ge´ On-\ntology Editor is used to create both the ontology and SWRL\nrules to form the knowledge base required for analysing pro-\ncess runtime exceptions. Once specified, the rules are loaded\ninto the Event Server for access at runtime (see fig. 13).\nAt runtime, a Java stateless session servlet (Process Mon-\nitoring Bean in fig. 13) is invoked at every time interval (set\nin configuration properties before application deployment)\nto calculate various process measurements. For example,\nusing the rule definition given previously, the current pro-\ncess utilization level can be calculated and compared against\na minimum acceptable value defined during the process de-\nsign phase. The details of the process and metric are sup-\nplied to the Bossam reasoner (Jang & Sohn 2004) where the\nSWRL rules are used to reason if the metric supplied, and\ntherefore the process, are outside normal limits of execution.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":13,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[494,601,722,618],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[459,255,760,588]}
