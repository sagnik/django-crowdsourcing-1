{"Caption":"Figure 2: ETH-80 (top row) and Birds (the second and third rows) datasets: 2 illustrative images per category.","ImageText":[],"Mention":["To assess the performance of our method, we have\nperformed experiments on two image databases \u2013\nETH-80 (Leibe and Schiele, 2003) and Birds (Lazeb-\nnik et al., 2005) \u2013 to discover object groups. Sev-\neral example images from the databases are shown\nin Fig. 2. We used only four categories from the\nETH-80: Apple, Car, Cow, and Cup. Each category\ncontains images of 10 to 14 objects under different\nviewpoints, against a flat blue background. The Birds\ndatabase contains six categories where each category\nincludes 100 images. It is a challenging database in-\ncluding images with large intra-class, scale, and view-\npoint variability. Furthermore, birds appear against\nhighly cluttered backgrounds.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[138,348,687,361],"Height":1169,"Width":827,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[143,135,687,335]}
