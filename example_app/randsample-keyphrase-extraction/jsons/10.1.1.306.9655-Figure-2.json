We envision a typical usage\nscenario in Figures 2 and 3. Here a client sends a single\ntransformation key once to the proxy, who can then re-\ntrieve (potentially large) ABE ciphertexts that the user is\ninterested in and forward to her (small, constant-size) El\nGamal-type ciphertexts. The proxy could be the client\u2019s\nmail server, or the ciphertext server and the proxy could\nbe the same entity, as in a cloud environment.\nThe savings in bandwidth and local computation time\nfor the client are immediate: a transformed ciphertext\nis always smaller and faster to decrypt than an ABE ci-\nphertext of [24, 42] (for any policy size). We emphasize\nin this useage scenario that the number of transmissions\nwill be the same as in the prior (non-outsourced) solu-\ntions. Thus, the power consumption can only improve\nwith faster computations and smaller transmissions.\n"],"Page":3,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,187,412,218],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[108,101,405,167]}
