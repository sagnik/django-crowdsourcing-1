The watermark\nconsidered was 10 bits long, all the presented data is\nthe result of an averaging process with 15 passes (each\nseeded with a different key), aimed at smoothing out\ndata-dependent biases and singularities.\nIn the first experiment we analyzed the behavior of\nthe embedded watermark in the presence of massive\ndata alterations. As the attack size grows (random\nalterations to the data), the watermark distortion\nincreases. The error correction mechanism (majority\nvoting in this case) does a good job in error recovery.\nThis is particularly so in the case of random alterations\nto the underlying data, the only available data altering\nattack option as discussed in Section 4.4. Figure 4,\ndepicts this phenomena for two values of e.\nThe next experiment aims at exploring the relation-\nship between the amount of alterations required in\nthe watermarking phase and a minimum guaranteed\nwatermark resilience. It can be seen in Figure 5\nthat as e increases (decreasing number of encoding\nalterations) the vulnerability to random alteration\nattacks increases accordingly. This illustrates the\ntrade-off between the requirement to be resilient and\nthe preservation of data quality (e.g. fewer alterations).\n"],"Page":10,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[444,323,742,358],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[459,93,726,285]}
