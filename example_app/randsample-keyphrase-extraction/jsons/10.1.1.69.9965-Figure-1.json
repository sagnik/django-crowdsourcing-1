{"Caption":"Figure 1: (a): Cumulative time spent by G AMBLE TA on the SAT-UNSAT problem set (109 ≈ 1 min.). Upper 95% confidence bounds on 50 runs, with random reordering of the problems. O RACLE is the lower bound on performance. U NIFORM is the (0.5,0.5) share. S ATZ -R AND is the single algorithm. (b): Experiments with G AMBLE R (G) and Satz-Rand (S) on the GC benchmarks. Time to solve each set of problems. U is the universal restart strategy; L∗ (set), a lower bound on the performance of the unknown optimal restart strategy for the whole set. L∗ (inst) is instead a lower bound on the performance of a distinct optimal restart strategy for each instance. The difference of these two bounds is an indirect measure of the heterogeneity of the RTD of the instances in each set. We also run experiments with all the 900 instances grouped as a single set (labeled A in the graph). In problem sets 1 to 5 we see the effect of a heavy-tailed RTD. S solves each set with times between 1.6 × 1010 (1) and 4.6 × 1012 (3). Upper 95% confidence bounds estimated on 20 runs, with random reordering of the problems, and different random seeds for Satz-Rand.
