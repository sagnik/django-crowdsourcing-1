a user runs a KaZaA client application, the client estab-\nlishes a connection with an \u201Cindexing\u201D hosts, called supernodes [9].\nThe client has a hard-coded list of possible supernodes. These su-\npernodes form an overlay network with other supernodes and prop-\nagate queries received from their client hosts. Any client host may\nserver as a supernode if it is accessible from the Internet (i.e., not\nbehind a firewall or a NAT box) and is connected with a fast enough\nlink [10, 9].\nWhen a client connects to a supernode, it sends two types of\ninformation to the supernode [10]. The first is the list of files that\nthe peering client host has in the sharing folder 2 [4]. A supernode\ncreates and updates a search index using the information received\nfrom client hosts. Second, the client informs the peering supernode\nof the host\u2019s information, such as a client nickname, a (download)\nport number, and an IP address at which other clients can request a\nfile download.\nA user can locate a file by issuing a query that contain a sub-\nstring of the name of the file of interest. Each query is sent to\na directly connected supernode, which is called a parent supern-\node [10]. Figure 1 illustrates an example. A user who is looking\nfor an ICQ chatting client sends a query \u201CICQ\u201D to the parent supern-\node. If the parent supernode is unable to find a match for the query,\nit forwards the query to other peering supernodes and the search\ncontinues until the TTL reaches zero [12].
