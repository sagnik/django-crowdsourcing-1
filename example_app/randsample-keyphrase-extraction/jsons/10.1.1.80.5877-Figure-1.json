The target functions are given\nin the top row of figure 2 and are illustrated in figure 1(a-d). A randomGaussian noise with\nzero mean and a variance of \r \u0010 \u0011 was added to the function value of the training points.\nClearly, only the first feature is relevant for the first two target functions, and only the first\ntwo features are relevant for the last two target functions. Note also that the last function\nis a smoothed version of parity function learning and is considered hard for many feature\nselection algorithms [2].\n","First, to illustrate the importance of feature selection on regression quality we use kNN to\nestimate the second target function. Figure 1(e-f) shows the regression results for target\n(b), using either only the relevant feature or both the relevant and an irrelevant feature.\nThe addition of one irrelevant feature degrades the MSE ten fold. Next, to demonstrate\nthe capabilities of the various algorithms, we run them on each of the above problems with\nvarying training set size. We measure their success by counting the number of times that\nthe relevant features were assigned the highest rank (repeating the experiment  \u0012 \r times by\nre-sampling the training set).
