There is only a single pa-\nrameter, the marking threshold, K. An arriving packet is marked\nwith the CE codepoint if the queue occupancy is greater than K\nupon it\u2019s arrival. Otherwise, it is not marked. This scheme en-\nsures that sources are quickly notified of the queue overshoot. The\nRED marking scheme implemented by most modern switches can\nbe re-purposed for DCTCP. We simply need to set both the low and\nhigh thresholds to K, and mark based on instantaneous, instead of\naverage queue length.\n(2) ECN-Echo at the Receiver: The only difference between a\nDCTCP receiver and a TCP receiver is the way information in the\nCE codepoints is conveyed back to the sender. RFC 3168 states\nthat a receiver sets the ECN-Echo flag in a series of ACK packets\nuntil it receives confirmation from the sender (through the CWR\nflag) that the congestion notification has been received. A DCTCP\nreceiver, however, tries to accurately convey the exact sequence of\nmarked packets back to the sender. The simplest way to do this is\nto ACK every packet, setting the ECN-Echo flag if and only if the\npacket has a marked CE codepoint.\nHowever, using Delayed ACKs is important for a variety of rea-\nsons, including reducing the load on the data sender. To use de-\nlayed ACKs (one cumulative ACK for every m consecutively re-\nceived packets 3), the DCTCP receiver uses the trivial two state\nstate-machine shown in Figure 10 to determine whether to set ECN-\nEcho bit. The states correspond to whether the last received packet\nwas marked with the CE codepoint or not. Since the sender knows\nhow many packets each ACK covers, it can exactly reconstruct the\nruns of marks seen by the receiver.\n(3) Controller at the Sender: The sender maintains an estimate of\nthe fraction of packets that are marked, called α, which is updated\nonce for every window of data (roughly one RTT) as follows:\n","Queue length Figure 14:\n(10Gbps)\n"],"Page":5,"Number":10,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[465,157,745,175],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[483,61,725,152]}
