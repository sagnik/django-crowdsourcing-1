{"Caption":"Figure 3: Link state when X sends communication to friend Y .

In the example in the previous para-\ngraph, Ostra raises the lower bound for the X ↔ Y link\nby one. This single adjustment has the effect of raising\nX\u2019s lower bound and lowering Y \u2019s upper bound, because\nthe lower bound on the X ↔ Y link can be viewed as\nthe upper bound on the Y ↔ X link. Figure 3 shows the\nstate of the X ↔ Y link during each stage of the trans-\naction. By adjusting the balance this way for outstand-\ning tokens, Ostra ensures that the link balance remains\nwithin its range regardless of how the pending commu-\nnication events are classified.\nLater, in the classification stage, user Y provides Os-\ntra with the token and the decision whetherX\u2019s commu-\nnication was wanted. The balance range adjustment that\nwas performed in the authorization phase is then undone.\nMoreover, if Y reports that the communication was un-\nwanted, Ostra adjusts the balance on the X ↔ Y link\nby subtracting one, thereby transferring a credit from X\n"],"Page":8,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,245,413,344],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[123,99,390,229]}
