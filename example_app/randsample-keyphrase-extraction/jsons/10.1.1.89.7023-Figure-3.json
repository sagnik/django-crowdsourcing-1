The graph in Figure 3 shows the performance\nof the dne estimator for Query 1 of the TPCH decision sup-\nport benchmark [17]. We generated a 1 GB TPCH database\nwith a skew factor of 2 [18]. The graph plots the progress\nas estimated by the dne estimator on the y axis and the\nactual progress (according to the getnext model) on the x\naxis. As the graph shows, the dne estimator is almost ex-\nactly accurate. For this pipeline, it turns out that Âµ is 1.98\nand var is 0.01, which is extremely small. This confirms\nour intuition that the dne estimator would work well in such\nscenarios. Note that this behavior is in spite of errors in\ncardinality estimates (recall that the data has high skew).\n","What about the pmax estimator? Consider TPCH Query 1,\nwhere we showed previously that the dne estimator is very\neffective (Figure 3), with an average error of less than 1%).\nOn this query, the pmax algorithm results in an average\nerror of around 11%. The fact that the variance in per-\ntuple \u201Ccosts\u201D is small is not exploited by the pmax estimator,\nwhereas if the variance is indeed small as it is for this query,\nthe dne estimator is very effective.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[451,273,760,286],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[444,74,768,257]}
