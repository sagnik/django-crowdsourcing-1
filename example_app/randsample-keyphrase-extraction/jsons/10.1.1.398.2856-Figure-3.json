If c.v has not been visited, we invade\ntriangle c.t, which has the effect of expanding the ring by replac-\ning the ring edge facing c with the other two edges of the invaded\ntriangle. Otherwise, if c.v has been visited, we backtrack until we\nfind a ring edge through which we may continue the invasion. This\nbacktracking is accomplished without a stack or recursion by slid-\ning along the ring (c = c.o) and by using the t.m and v.m flags as\n\u201Cbreadcrumbs\u201D to keep track of where we have been.
