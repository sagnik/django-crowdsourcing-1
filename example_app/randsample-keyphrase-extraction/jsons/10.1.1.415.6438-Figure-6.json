If our models are rep-\nresentative, then the probability of overflow computed using\nteletraffic theory should be an upper bound on the numerical\nestimate. Table 5 shows the results, indicating that our ref-\nerence models are representative, at least for the purpose of\ntransformer sizing in the electrical grid. This result, though\npositive, does not give a good \u2018feel\u2019 for our models. A less\nanalytical, but still useful, validation is by visual inspection.\nFigure 6 shows actual measurements of on-peak loads of a\nhome in class 1 obtained from the test data set. We see that\nit is similar to the on-peak home load generated from the\non-peak model of class 1 (Figure 7). This was true for all of\nour other models as well.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,474,407,502],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[87,226,370,450]}
