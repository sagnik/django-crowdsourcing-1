Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show some experimental re-\nsults in the hockey sequences. We can observe that the sys-\ntem can track a single hockey player and recognize his ac-\ntions effectively even though the player constantly changes\nhis pose. Moreover, the tracker is also robust under sig-\nnificant illumination changes (flashes) because we rely on\nshape rather than color information. Fig. 5 also indicates\nthat the tracker is robust under partial occlusions. A pos-\nsible explanation is that we project the HOG descriptor to\nits principal subspace and thus the influences of other play-\ners in the tracking region can be alleviated. Unfortunately,\nwhen two players cross over, further techniques such as [2]\nare needed to tackle the occlusion problem.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[84,928,740,976],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[135,546,692,912]}
