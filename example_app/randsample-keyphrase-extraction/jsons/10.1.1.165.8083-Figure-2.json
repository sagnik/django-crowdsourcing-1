Currently, participating\nmedia rendering algorithms model scattering media using a radiative\ntransfer model limited to isotropic media\u2014media whose properties\nare invariant to rotation. For instance, a cloud of steam filled with\nspherical water droplets fits within the standard model; or a cirrus\ncloud filled with randomly oriented ice crystals: either medium looks\nthe same to light traveling in different directions. But a volume filled\nwith aligned ice crystals; or hair, wood, or cloth fibers; or fibrous\ntissue like muscle or collagen; does not fit the usual model because\nits properties depend on orientation. This is the type of medium\nwe call anisotropic in this paper (Figure 2). (This is a deviation\nfrom the common usage in graphics, where \u201Canisotropic\u201D refers to\nscattering that depends on the scattering angle, such as the strong\nforward scattering exhibited by spherical water drops.)\n"],"Page":1,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[440,985,775,998],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[440,878,777,970]}
