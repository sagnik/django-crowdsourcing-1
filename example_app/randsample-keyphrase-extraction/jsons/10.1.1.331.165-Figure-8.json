The infrequent re-access\nof many files suggests there are opportunities for files\nto be archived or moved to lower-tier storage. Further,\nwe find that about 94% of files are accessed fewer than\nfive times. However, both of these distributions are long-\ntailed\u2014some files are opened well over 100,000 times.\nThese frequently re-opened files account for about 7%\nof total opens in both workloads.
