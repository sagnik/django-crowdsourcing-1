{"Caption":"Figure 2: Tour snapshots","ImageText":[],"Mention":["The live test-bed for the proposed system was during\na crowded international scientific conference held in the\nBotanical Garden in Sept. 2007. The robot performed sev-\neral tours, covering more than 3 km in a day. Figure 2 shows\nsome snapshots taken during the tour.\nOdometric errors and sensor uncertainty underpinned any\neffort to build a map of the whole environment, leading us\nto choose a mapless navigation approach. We used a tourist\nmap (Figure 3) to figure out where to place exhibit nodes\nand navigation aid nodes.\nThe latter were introduced to avoid the robot being\ntrapped in local minima. Each node location was computed\nby averaging a set of GPS data taken during one whole day,\nto take into account satellite variations.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[539,323,679,337],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[441,82,795,300]}
