{"Caption":"Figure 12: Illustration of our optimization for the Polonium algorithm: since we have a bipartite graph (of files and machines), the naive version leads to two independent but equivalent paths of propagation of messages (orange, and blue arrows). Eliminating one path saves us half of the computation and storage for messages, with no loss of accuracy. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Overall, participants felt that Apolo improved their sense-\nmaking experience. Based on a post-test survey, Apolo\nseemed to be easy to use, as shown in Figure 11 and 12.\nThese results are encouraging given that Apolo was not de-\nsigned as a walk-up-and-use system.\n","In short, the two equations are completely decoupled,\nas indicated by the orange and blue edges in Figure 12.\nEither stream of computations will arrive at the same\nresults, so we can choose to use either one (say following\nthe orange arrows), eventually saving half of the effort.\n"],"Page":29,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[431,250,766,364],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[432,107,779,231]}
