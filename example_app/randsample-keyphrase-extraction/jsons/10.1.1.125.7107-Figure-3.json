{"Caption":"Figure 3: Relative average log probability per data-point for test data as a function of N . ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["coefficient1 c = 2. We studied the accuracy of each algorithm\nas a function of the number of data cases and the truncation\nlevel of the approximation. In figures 2 and 3 we show the\nresults as we vary N (keeping T and K fixed at 30) while in\nfigures 4 and 5 we plot the results as we vary T and K (keep-\ning N fixed at 200). We plot both the absolute value of the log\nprobability of test data and the value relative to a Gibbs sam-\npler (GS). We 50 iterations for burn-in, and run another 200\niterations for inference. Error bars are computed on the rela-\ntive values in order to subtract variance caused by the differ-\nent splits (i.e. we measure variance on paired experiments).\n"],"Page":5,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,692,412,720],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[79,434,396,674]}
