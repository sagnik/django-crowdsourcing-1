While such comparison is not provided in\nP6, we provide one here (Figure 24). The running times for WalkSAT are\nfrom the fast implementation of the method found in the UBCSAT SLS\nsolver [232]. The running times for BC SLS are from a current implementa-\ntion by T. Junttila in which the computation of heuristics (justification front,\ncone, interest set) is incremental. The time out was set to 5 minutes, with the\ntimed out runs on the horizontal and vertical lines. The data points represent\nthe running times in a similar fashion as in Figure 23 for moves. We notice\nthat, while WalkSAT and BC SLS seem to be equally competitive on easier\ninstances, BC SLS shows better scalability as instances get harder. Especially\nnoticeable is the large number of timed out runs for WalkSAT.\n"],"Page":78,"Number":24,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[195,378,563,394],"Height":984,"Width":693,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[180,92,473,363]}
