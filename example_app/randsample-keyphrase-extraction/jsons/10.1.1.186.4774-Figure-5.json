We use k-fold cross validation to\ntrain and test RIPPER, where k varies from 2 to 20. For\neach value of k, we repeat the experiment 10 times and take\nthe average.\nAs described before, there are 3 feature sets: \u201Cbasic\u201D, \u201Cba-\nsic+\u201D and \u201Cbasic++\u201D. Figure 5 shows that additional fea-\ntures generally improve the accuracy. However, too many\nfeatures may reduce the accuracy in some cases. This is\ndifferent from the result in [9], where the full feature set\n(\u201Cbasic++\u201D) gets the highest accuracy. For the results of\nRIPPER reported hereafter, it is based on using the feature\nset \u201Cbasic++\u201D.\n"],"Page":7,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,758,407,772],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[110,551,371,748]}
