{"Caption":"Figure 6: These scatter plots show how the number of users that like an article affects its recall. Red lines indicate the average. In these plots, the number of recommended articles is 100. CF can not do out-of-matrix prediction. This shows that CTR performs best over article-oriented recall as well. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["varies as a function of the number of articles in a user\u2019s library;\nFigure 6 shows how the performance varies as a function of the\nnumber of users that like an article.\nAs we see from Figure 5, for both in-matrix and out-of-matrix\nprediction, users with more articles tend to have less variance in\ntheir predictions. Users with few articles tend to have a diversity in\nthe predictions, whose recall values vary around the extreme values\nof 0 and 1. In addition, we see that recall for users with more articles\nhave a decreasing trend. This is reasonable because when a user has\nmore articles then there will be more infrequent ones. As we see\nnext, these articles are harder to predict.\nFrom Figure 6, on in-matrix prediction for CF, CTR and LDA\narticles with high frequencies tend to have high recalls for in-matrix\nprediction and their predictions have less variance. This is because\nthese articles have more collaborative information than infrequent\nones, and, furthermore, CF and CTR make use of this information.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,501,772,543],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[82,322,755,490]}
