{"Caption":"Figure 1: Tree of Analyzed Webpage Example","ImageText":[],"Mention":["In the second stage, attachment rules are \nchecked against possible attachment sites. Rules \nthat fire successfully attach the BDU-Tree to the \nDPT at the chosen site with the relationship speci-\nfied by the rule. Local semantic, lexical and syn-\ntactic information is then percolated into the par-\nent DCU. If multiple attachments at different sites \nare possible, ambiguous parses are generated; less \npreferred attachments are discarded and the re-\nmaining attachment choices generate valid parse \ntrees. \nOnce a BDU-tree has been attached, its leaves \nbecome terminal nodes of the DPT and nodes on \nits right edge are accessible for continuation and \nmay serve as contextual anchors for subsequent \nsentences. Table 5 shows an example text taken \nfrom the FXPAL Webpage describing our re-\nsearch group, a segmentation of the text and the \nDPT constructed following the rules. Figure 1 \ngives a screenshot of the resulting tree. \n"],"Page":7,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[467,582,738,600],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[446,462,747,578]}
