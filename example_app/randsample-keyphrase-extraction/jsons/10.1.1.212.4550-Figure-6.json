Although\nthe IRSCP decision process could conceivably re-rank\negress links in response to IGP distances, it generally\ndoes not do so for several reasons. First, for applica-\ntions such as load balancing customer traf\u0002c, strict adher-\nence to a shortest-path policy appears to be of secondary\nimportance. Indeed, tracking IGP distance changes can\nhave adverse effects, such as causing large volumes of\ntraf\u0002c to shift inadvertently [33]. The explicit ranking\nprovided by an application introduces a degree of sta-\nbility, effectively \u0093pinning\u0094 routes. If it is necessary to\nrespond to IGP changes, we require the application to do\nso by providing an updated ranking. Teixeira et al. [32]\nsuggest that in a large ISP with suf\u0002cient path diversity\nin its IGP topology the latency of MPLS tunnels is not\ngreatly affected by IGP changes. For these cases, route\npinning does not sacri\u0002ce much performance in terms of\nlatency.\nHowever, we do wish to handle the case in which IGP\ndistances \u0093balloon\u0094 excessively, effectivelymaking some\negress routes unusable. For example, this can occurwhen\nphysical connectivity is disrupted and IGP diverts traf\u0002c\naround the disruption. Another example is router main-\ntenance: typically the maintenance procedure involves\nsetting the IGP distance between the router and the rest\nof the network to a very high value in order to gracefully\nmove the traf\u0002c away from the router before it is brought\ndown.\nThe network shown in Figure 6 has three egress routes\nfor some given destination: through PEs\n \n\u0015T\u0007\nand\n\r\n.\nThe application has assigned the egress route through PE\n \nto PEs\n\u0003\nand\n \nand the egress route through\n\r\nto\nPEs\n\u0007\nand\n\r\n. In Figure 6(b) several IGP distances have\nballooned, making PE\n\u0003\n's preferred egress route through\n \nvirtually unusable for PE\n\u0003\n, although\n\u0003\n's rankings\nhave not yet been updated.\nWe de\u0002ne an Emergency Exit procedure for cases such\n"],"Page":9,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[435,235,749,314],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[436,98,751,209]}
