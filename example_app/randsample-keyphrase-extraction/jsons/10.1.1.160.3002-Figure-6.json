{"Caption":" Figure 6. A mock-up of a ZOIL-based library catalog. The amount of displayed information is reduced by specifying the   desired years of publication (\u201CJahr\u201D) and the name of a              desired cast member (\u201CPersonen\u201D). ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["At the current stage of our project we have formulated five \ndesign principles for ZOIL user interfaces and have applied \nthem in mock-ups and Java prototypes for document \nmanagement [26] (see figure 3) and digital libraries [20] \n(see figure 6). The design principles are based on our \nprevious research work on Zoomable User Interfaces \n(ZUIs) [19, 20, 25], visual information seeking [17] and \ninformation visualization (IV) [33]. Furthermore they have \ndrawn from a broad scope of existing designs and theories \nin the HCI, IV and PIM literature. \n","To control the information that goes into such portals a \nZOIL UI offers different direct manipulation techniques. \nFor example the user can manually assign items or item \ncollections to a portal by using a pick, drag and drop \ninteraction as an equivalent to copying in today\u2019s desktop \nmetaphor. Furthermore dynamic queries [4] can be used to \nformulate search queries on the information space (e.g. \ndesktop and web search) that automatically fill the portal \nwith the result set of information items. Figure 6 illustrates \nhow metadata like \u201CYear\u201D and \u201CPersons\u201D could be used to \nsearch for DVDs in the information space and to iteratively \nspecify the desired items. In this example a range slider is \nused to specify the desired years of publication. \nFurthermore an incremental keyword search is used to find \nall DVDs with a certain cast member by typing the first \nletters of the person\u2019s name.  \n"],"Page":6,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[430,956,749,1013],"Height":1169,"Width":827,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[436,253,745,944]}
