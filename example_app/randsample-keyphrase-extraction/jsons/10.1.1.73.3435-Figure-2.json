{"Caption":"Figure 2: A: Extrapolated cost functions Cm (∆|n) plotted against 1\/∆ for several numbers of se- quences m = 10, 20 and 30 computed from n = 10 sample sequences. B: The plot of {1\/m, 1\/∆∗ } used for estimating the critical value 1\/m = 1\/ˆ nc , above which 1\/∆∗ practically vanishes. C: The number of spike sequences n used to obtain the extrapolated cost function Cm (∆|n) and an esti- mated critical number n ˆ c . Model parameters: the number of sequences n = 10; total observation period T = 30 [sec]; the mean rate µ = 30 [1\/s]; the amplitude of rate fluctuation σ = 4 [1\/s]; time scale of rate fluctuation τ = 0.05 [s]. The theoretical critical number is computed with Eq.(24), giving nc = 21.1 for the present underlying fluctuating rate. This theoretical nc is depicted as the horizontal dashed line.
