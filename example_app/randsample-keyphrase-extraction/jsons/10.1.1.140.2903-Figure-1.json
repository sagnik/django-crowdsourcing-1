{"Caption":"Figure 1.

Remember that the abstract class \nTransaction has an aggregation named accounts, \nrepresenting the set of accounts involved in a transaction \n(see Figure 1), and both of the OCL constraints are written \nin terms of this aggregation. As shown in Figure 5 below, \nwe introduce a JML model variable for this aggregation. \nThe model variable has the same name as that of the \naggregation and is of type OclSet. The OclSet class is from \nour new JML library and implements OCL\u2019s set. The rest \nof the specifications are identical to the previous one except \nfor renaming of the method to follow the OCL\u2019s naming \nconvention. \n"],"Page":3,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[489,271,713,286],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[456,133,760,262]}
