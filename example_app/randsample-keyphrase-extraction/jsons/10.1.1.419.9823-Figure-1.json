{"Caption":"Figure 1: (a) Regions of dt -space where classifiers jt = 1, 2, 3 will respectively be selected. (b) All weight vectors d2 , ..., dtmax are restricted to lie on the edges of the inner triangle. one-dimensional map defined on the unfolded triangle, since within one iteration every trajectory lands on the triangle. This map and its iterates are piecewise continuous and monotonic in each piece, so one can find exactly where each interval will be mapped (see Figure 2(a)). Consider the second iteration of this map (Figure 2(b)). One can break the un- folded triangle into intervals and find the region of attraction of each fixed cycle; in fact the whole triangle is the union of both regions of attraction. The convergence to one of these two 3-cycles is very fast; Figure 2(b) shows that the absolute slope of the second iterated map at the fixed points is much less than 1.
