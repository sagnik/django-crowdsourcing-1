Section 22 was used as development\nset for intermediate results. All of section 23 was re-\nserved for the final test. We used the EVALB parseval\nreference implementation, available from Sekine and\nCollins (1997), for scoring. All reported development\nset results are averages over four runs. For the final test\nwe selected the grammar that performed best on the de-\nvelopment set.\nOur experiments are based on a completely unanno-\ntated X-bar style grammar, obtained directly from the\nPenn Treebank by the binarization procedure shown in\nFigure 1. For each local tree rooted at an evaluation\nnonterminal X , we introduce a cascade of new nodes\nlabeled X so that each has two children. Rather than\nexperiment with head-outward binarization as in Klein\nand Manning (2003), we simply used a left branching\nbinarization; Matsuzaki et al. (2005) contains a com-\nparison showing that the differences between binariza-\ntions are small.\n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[111,226,391,240],"Height":1169,"Width":827,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[129,98,344,200]}
