{"Caption":"Figure 11: The job execution detail visualization highlights both the progress of tasks over time, and the volume of data processed. Each node is divided on five stripes that represent the degree of anomalies in tasks executing during the corresponding time slot; the size of the square represents the proportion of I\/O processed by that node.
