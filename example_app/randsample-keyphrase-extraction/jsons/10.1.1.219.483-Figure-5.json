The IMAP\nspecification defines that each client command must be pre-\nfixed with a tag in the form of a short alphanumeric string\n(e.g., \u20181\u2019, \u2018alpha2\u2019, etc.). The protocol also allows a parame-\nter to be sent in literal form. In this case, the parameter is\nsent as a sequence of bytes prefix-quoted with a byte count\nbetween curly brackets, followed by a CR-LF.
