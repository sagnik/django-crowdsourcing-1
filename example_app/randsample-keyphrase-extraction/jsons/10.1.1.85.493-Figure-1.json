Similar to [6], given two point sets, we \u0002t a GMM to the \u0002rst point set,\nwhose Gaussian centroids are initialized from the points in the second set. However, unlike [5, 6, 10]\nwhich assumes a thin-plate spline transformation, we do not make any explicit assumption of the\ntransformation model. Instead, we consider the process of adapting the Gaussian centroids from\ntheir initial positions to their \u0002nal positions as a temporal motion process, and impose a motion\ncoherence constraint over the velocity \u0002eld. Velocity coherence is a particular way of imposing\nsmoothness on the underlying transformation. The concept of motion coherence was proposed in\nthe Motion Coherence Theory [11]. The intuition is that points close to one another tend to move\ncoherently. This motion coherence constraint penalizes derivatives of all orders of the underlying\nvelocity \u0002eld (thin-plate spline only penalizes the second order derivative). Examples of velocity\n\u0002elds with different levels of motion coherence for different point correspondence are illustrated in\nFig. 1.\n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[148,755,699,776],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[197,640,655,748]}
