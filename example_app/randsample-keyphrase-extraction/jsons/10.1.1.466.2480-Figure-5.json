As a consequence, the relative criticality\nf an action may vary depending on the agent plan it belongs\no. The relative criticality is calculated as follows:\n\u2022 For an external action, it is equal to the local rela-\ntive criticality (LRC). The LRC is obtained using the\nAND-aggregation function if the action is connected\nto its children by means of AND edges or the OR-\n","hat at each given instant of time, the agent is executing at\nost one action.\nUsing the same approach established by [16], we repre-\nent the plan of an agent as a directed acyclic AND\/OR\nraph where each node represents an action.
