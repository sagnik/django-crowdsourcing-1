After \ninformally experimenting with a variety of gestures, we \ndeveloped a simple set of gestures with the aim of \nmaximizing memorability and robustness of execution \n(Figure 3). We assigned the directional commands UP, DOWN, \nLEFT and RIGHT to spatial gestures that map directly to their \nfunction. We assigned ACTIVATE and CANCEL to the two \ngestures defined by pivoting the thumb from bottom to top \nand top to bottom respectively. We made these assignments \nboth to reinforce their opposing relationship as well as for \nergonomic ease in issuing common commands. Finally, we \nassigned the upper-left to lower-right diagonal to FORWARD \ndue to its relative forward nature, and by similar reasoning, \nthe reverse gesture to BACKWARD.  \n"],"Page":4,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,296,209,326],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[83,137,226,282]}
