We use the same laptop and\nserver as in the static experiment, but now the laptop\nuser moves between floors of the building. The building\nhas reasonable WiFi coverage on most floors but not on\nthe staircases. 3G coverage is acceptable but is some-\ntimes heavily congested by other users.\nThe experiment starts with one TCP running over the\n3G interface and one over WiFi, both downloading data\nfrom an otherwise idle university server. A multipath\nflow then starts, using both interfaces, downloading data\nfrom the same server. Fig.17 shows the throughputs over\neach link (each point is a 5s average). Again, WiFi is\nshown above the dashed line, 3G is shown inverted be-\nlow the dashed line, and the total throughput of the mul-\ntipath flow can be clearly seen from the vertical range of\nthe gray region.\n"],"Page":10,"Number":17,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[453,288,736,352],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[482,83,707,276]}
