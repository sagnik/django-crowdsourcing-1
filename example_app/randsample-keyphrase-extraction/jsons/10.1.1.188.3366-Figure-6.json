First, if threads\ndo not touch shared data, i.e., if they do not commu-\nnicate, their execution will be deterministic no matter\nhow they are scheduled. Second, when threads do com-\nmunicate, a trivial deterministic schedule is to divide\neach thread\u2019s execution into chunks and then execute all\nchunks in a deterministic serial order.\nFollowing these observations, execution in DMP-O is\ndivided into chunks called quanta. A round consists of\nall threads executing one quantum each. Each round is\ndivided into a parallel mode and a serial mode. In paral-\nlel mode, threads run in parallel but are isolated; they do\nnot communicate. In serial mode, threads run serially but\ncan communicate arbitrarily. A thread ends its parallel\nmode once it has reached an instruction that might com-\nmunicate with other threads. Serial mode begins once all\nthreads have completed parallel mode, and ends once all\nthreads have had a chance to run. The parallel and serial\nmodes are thus isolated by global barriers into two-stage\nrounds, as illustrated in Figure 6.\nNotice that the parallel and serial modes are directly\ninspired from the two key observations stated above.\nDMP-O is deterministic as long as threads are (1) bro-\n"],"Page":5,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[443,218,742,266],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[438,91,750,217]}
