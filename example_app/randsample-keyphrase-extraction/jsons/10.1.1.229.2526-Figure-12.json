{"Caption":"Figure 12. Comparison of our method with Poisson surface reconstruction algorithm [17]. Both methods use surface orientation informa- tion. Two images on the right show that both methods work well when points come with accurate estimates of surface normals (here we used surface normals generated by VRIP reconstruction [10]). Two images on the left show the results obtained when data points had only weak orientation information (direction towards the scanner) clearly demonstrating that our flux-based approach is much less sensitive to accuracy of surface orientation information.
