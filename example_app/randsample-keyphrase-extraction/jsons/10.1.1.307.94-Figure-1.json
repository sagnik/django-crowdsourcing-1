To simplify,\nan application\u2019s only interface to the phone is through\nthese APIs. Each application is executed within a Dalvik\nVirtual Machine (DVM) running under a unique UNIX\nuid. The phone comes pre-installed with a selection of\nsystem applications, e.g., phone dialer, address book.\nApplications interact with each other and the phone\nthrough different forms of IPC. Intents are typed inter-\nprocess messages that are directed to particular appli-\ncations or systems services, or broadcast to applications\nsubscribing to a particular intent type. Persistent content\nprovider data stores are queried through SQL-like inter-\nfaces. Background services provide RPC and callback\ninterfaces that applications use to trigger actions or ac-\ncess data. Finally user interface activities receive named\naction signals from the system and other applications.\nBinder acts as a mediation point for all IPC. Access\nto system resources (e.g., GPS receivers, text messag-\ning, phone services, and the Internet), data (e.g., address\nbooks, email) and IPC is governed by permissions as-\nsigned at install time.
