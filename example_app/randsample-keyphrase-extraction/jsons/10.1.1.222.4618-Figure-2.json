As a power source, so-\nlar cells behave very differently from batteries. The measured I-V\ncurve of the 4-4.0-100 solar panel from Solar World [11] is shown\nin Figure 2.1. It is clear that unlike batteries, solar panels behave as\nvoltage-limited current sources with the operating point (i.e., out-\nput voltage and current) determined by the electrical impedance\nimposed by the load. Also, as marked in the figure, there is an\noperating point on the I-V curve where maximum instantaneous\npower is delivered by the solar panel. To maximize the total energy\noutput over the course of the system\u2019s lifetime, the panel should be\noperated as close as possible to this maximal power point (MPP)\nfor as long as possible. However, this is not simple to achieve since\nthe MPP depends on several time-varying parameters such as solar\nirradiance, panel temperature, etc.\nA commonly used technique to ensure MPP operation is to iso-\nlate the load (i.e., sensor node) from the solar panel using a switch-\ning regulator. The switching characteristics of the regulator de-\ntermine the effective impedance seen by the panel and hence, the\noperating point on the I-V curve. Since the regulator\u2019s character-\nistics can be software-controlled, the system can track the MPP as\nit changes using a perturb-and-observe approach. However, the en-\nergy benefits of MPP tracking using this method might be offset by\nthe energy consumed by the extra tracking circuitry itself. An alter-\nnative approach used in the Heliomote [7] solar harvesting module\nis to clamp the outputs of the panel to a secondary battery, which\nfixes the panel\u2019s operating point. The authors demonstrate that, by\ncarefully choosing the panel and battery, near-MPP operation can\nbe obtained. Although sub-optimal from an MPP tracking point of\nview, this approach is attractive since it is virtually overhead free.\n","It is graphically represented in Figure 2.
