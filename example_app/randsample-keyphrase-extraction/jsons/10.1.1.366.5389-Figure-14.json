Figure 14 shows the results for the top\n10 most popular social websites. The first component is dominated\nby flow size, session size and inter-packet gap, while the second\ncomponent reflects different packet size. For example, Facebook\nand Tuenti are in different clusters because their flows and sessions\nare quite different hence they are far apart in the first component.\nSimilarly, Tuenti and twitter are in separate clusters as their packet\nsizes differ significantly.\nWe examined all metrics of social applications but, due to the\nlimited space, we focus on one metric, the number of flows in ses-\nsions of the same size, using Tuenti and Twitter from different clus-\nters as examples. To deliver the same amount of data, some appli-\ncations may use a few long flows while others may use multiple\nsmall flows. Figure 12 shows that for Twitter the number of flows\n"],"Page":5,"Number":14,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[75,743,405,756],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[82,477,400,714]}
