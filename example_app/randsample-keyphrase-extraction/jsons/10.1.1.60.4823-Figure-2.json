The specialization is compatible with the\nCORBA specification since no changes are made to the CORBA\ninterfaces.\nAll experiments were performed on an Intel Pentium III 851 Mhz\nprocessor with 512 MB of main memory running on Linux 2.4.7-\ntimesys-3.1.214 kernel, which contains a very predictable real-time\nkernel module. The TAO middleware used for the experiments was\nversion 1.4.7, which was compiled with gcc version 3.2.2.\nFigure 1 shows the footprint and throughput improvements ac-\ncrued by the target object location specialization. As shown in\nthe figure, footprint for a collocated application improves by ∼40\nkiloBytes, which is a 12% improvement over the general-purpose\nTAO implementation. This specialization also removes redundant\ntests along the critical path, which improves end-to-end throughput\nby ∼7% over the general-purpose collocation optimization imple-\nmented by TAO. These results show how eliminating redundant re-\nmoting functionality can improve size and performance of general-\npurpose middleware.\nFigure 2 illustrates the QoS improvements accrued by applying\nall of the middleware specializations discussed in Section 3.1 to a\nremote CORBA operation. The average end-to-end latency for the\nspecialized TAO dropped by ∼43%, while the dispersion measure\nwas twice as good as general-purpose optimized TAO implementa-\ntion, indicating considerable improvement in predictability, which\nis essential for DRE systems.\n"],"Page":3,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[445,956,764,969],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[466,733,746,939]}
