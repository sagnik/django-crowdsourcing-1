{"Caption":"Figure 2. Colors on one shape, propagated via transports to other shapes from a same video sequence (see text for details).","ImageText":[{"Text":"â†’","TextBB":[120.738,134.183,134.574,147.245],"Rotation":0}],"Mention":["In video sequences, each frame is relatively similar to\nthe next one, so that any temporal succession of observed\nshapes is a natural good path to transport through. In par-\nticular it is not possible to find a shape without close neigh-\nbors, and consequently information can be shared.\nWe present an example for a sequence of walking human\nsilhouettes, from the ViHASi dataset1. We compute auto-\nmatically pairwise matchings, and from them the best trans-\nport paths (without temporal order information). The paths\nobtained are strongly correlated to temporal ordering (for-\nwards or backwards). We pick one shape, add colors ran-\ndomly along it, and propagate color (as a function with val-\nues (r, g, b) in R3) through transports to all training shapes,\nin order to visualize correspondences. The result, in figure\n2 (see the supplementary materials for the whole video),\nis correct, validating the method. Of course a few match-\ning mistakes are sometimes observed when auto-occultation\nhappens, but these errors are few, and they are not propa-\ngated because these mismatchings cost more. Considering\nindividualized transports (part 2.3) would allow the trans-\nmission of information not related to the precise location\nwhere difficulties occur. For instance a hand gesture could\nbe transmitted to another silhouette with similar arm posi-\ntions even if the legs have been crossed in the meanwhile.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[105,184,716,197],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[71,91,757,184]}
