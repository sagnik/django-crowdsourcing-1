requirement that the sequences are the same length or\nperform the same physical task. Due to the poor repeata-\nbility and low precision of humans, the waypoints can be\nconsidered noise-corrupted. Furthermore, for a particular\ntask there may be many possible ways that the user could\nachieve the desired goal and it is difficult to instrument fully\nany realistic working environment. Consequently there\nwill always be hidden, or latent, causes for user behavior.\nWith these assumptions, one natural model of the user is a\nContinuous-Density Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM).\nWe have created a learning algorithm that is designed\nto cope with the characteristic difficulties of LBO: sparse\ntraining data, real-time operation, and a wide range of tar-\nget tasks. We assume that the PRP system has no a priori\nknowledge of what programs the user may create. There-\nfore we must induce the structure of the CDHMM, as well\nas parameters for the model, from observations alone (Fig-\nure 3). We consider the user as generating a each task\naccording to a random walk through an unknown target\nCDHMM. The learning algorithm begins by assigning one\nwaypoint to each node in a graph and encoding temporal\ninformation by edge connectivity, as in Figure 5(a). The\nalgorithm then searches for the most similar nodes in the\ngraph. If these nodes are sufficiently similar then the nodes\nare merged. That is, a new node is created containing the\n","found with the capacity to add all the waypoints from node\nv\nj\nthen the two nodes will be merged. This process repeats\nuntil no similar nodes exist. The nodes in the maximal\ngraph in Figure 5(a) are merged using a strict and a loose\ndefinition of similarity, in Figure 5(b) and Figure 5(c)\nrespectively. The resulting graphs are different since the\ndefinition of similarity was different. In Section 4.2, we\nshow how modifying the definition of similarity effects the\nprediction performance of the PRP system. With respect\nto computing the similarity between waypoint sequences,\nEquation 1 is memoryless in that the function does not\nconsider the similarity of ancestor or descendant waypoints.\nConsequently, it is possible for two sequences to be similar\nfor a single waypoint while being dissimilar for all others.\nWhile recursive similarity may be appropriate in some\ndomains (Ron et al., 1998), memoryless similarity seems\nmore appropriate for identifying similarities such as those\nshown in Figure 1. In a sense, the parameter \u000F behaves\nlike an initial node \u201Ccapacity\u201D, or a region within which\nfuture waypoints must lie. Let x\n0\nbe the first waypoint\nassigned to node v\ni\n. Any future waypoints assigned to\nnode v\ni\nmust lie inside a hyperellipse of radius \u000F whose\naxes are defined by the eigendecomposition of C and\ncentered about x\n0\n.
