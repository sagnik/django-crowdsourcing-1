of our empirical investigation involves taking a five-\nfold cross-validation approach over each dataset. In other\nwords, we randomly partition our data into five disjoint folds\nand apply four folds together to train a CF algorithm, and\nuse the remaining fold as a test set to evaluate the perfor-\nmance. We repeat this process five times for each dataset\nso that each fold is used as a test set once. The results we\npresent are averages over five folds.\nFirst we demonstrate the rating-prediction performance\nof ClustKnn. Figure 3 plots the predictive performance\nof ClustKnn both for the metrics NMAE and EU, and\nfor both of the datasets. Since ClustKnn can be regarded\nas approximating user-based KNN with the two becoming\n","equivalent when k equals the number of users in the sys-\ntem (assuming non-empty clusters), we have also included\nthe predictive performance of user-based KNN in the plots\n\u2014 to consider it as an upper bound for ClustKnn. As\ndepicted in figure 3, the performance of ClustKnn with\na moderate value of k, both by MAE and EU, is nearly\nas good as the user-based KNN. For example, on the Ml-\nCurrent dataset, which has more than 21,500 users, a\nClustKnn model with 200 clusters gives an NMAE of 0.37\nand EU=7.82 \u2014 very close to the corresponding user-based\nKNN results: NMAE=0.36 and EU=8.44. Furthermore, a\ntrend evident from the graph is that as k gets higher, accu-\nracy keeps improving.\nTable 3 compares prediction qualities of the ratings pro-\nduced by the selected CF algorithms. Note that each al-\ngorithm requires a few parameters to be set which can be\ncrucial for its better performance. For example, number of\nz in pLSA, σ in personality diagnosis, and so forth. We\nfollowed the suggestions and specifications found in the re-\nspective papers to tune the algorithms so that they perform\ntheir best.\nWe see from table 3 that SVD produced the best qual-\nity rating-predictions according to both NMAE and EU on\nthe Ml1m dataset. We did not have enough computational\nresources available to run our particular Matlab imple-\nmentation of SVD on the MlCurrent dataset. User and\nitem-based KNN produce the next best quality predictions.\nClustKnn with k=200 performs very well, and it is at least\nas accurate as pLSA and much better than the other hybrid\nmodel- and memory-based CF algorithm, personality diag-\nnosis. Interestingly, paying a close attention to the NMAE\nand EU columns, the finding of [24, 9] that CF evaluation\nmetrics correlate, becomes evident. Indeed, the correlation\ncoefficient between MAE and EU on Ml1m dataset is -0.94,\nand on MlCurrent dataset it is -0.97. Note that negative\ncorrelations are due to the fact that the directions of MAE\nand EU are opposite, i.e., MAE is an error metric and EU\nis a value metric. Next we turn into top-N recommendation\nresults.\nFigure 4 shows the interplay between precision and re-\ncall, and the resulting F1 for ClustKnn as N varies. The\npattern present in the figure is consistent across each of the\nCF algorithms we studied. Note that more than 50% of the\nusers have only 12 or fewer relevant items in the test sets\n"],"Page":6,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,556,772,584],"Height":1169,"Width":827,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[102,76,743,537]}
