In the first scenario, reconfigurations effec-\ntively occur in isolation, since a link is always replaced after\n0.1s, i.e., before a new reconfiguration occurs. In the sec-\nond scenario, instead, the system is undergoing continuous\nand frequent reconfiguration5.\nThe results we show in Figure 7 refer to this second case,\nwith the parameters in Table 1. In the figure, one can eas-\nily see that the performance of our algorithms is not reduced\nby dynamicity, whose perturbation is easily absorbed by the\nprobabilistic component of routing, and by the redundancy\nof the graph. As a matter of fact, event delivery even im-\nproves. This apparently counterintuitive result can be inter-\npreted in the light of well-known results on probabilistic al-\ngorithms, which suggest that for \u201Cinfection\u201D to be effective,\nrandom propagation should not occur only locally, but also\ninfect far away nodes. Therefore, dynamicity, by continu-\nously restructuring the connectivity among dispatchers, ef-\nfectively helps spreading information, by allowing nodes to\nsuddenly becoming in contact with a different set of neigh-\nbors, and spread messages from another point. Indeed, the\ncases that experience the biggest improvements are those\nthat rely most on probabilistic information, i.e., the purely\nprobabilistic and the one with φ = 1. Another contribu-\ntion to this increase is given by the way we reconfigure the\ngraph, which causes the degree to become l = 5± 1. Since\n","Limiting Propagation. Thus far, we never restrained prop-\nagation and assumed a TTL= ∞ for the sake of analyzing\nthe behavior of our approach. In practice, however, intro-\nducing a TTL enables considerable savings in overhead, as\nwe discussed in Section 3. Figure 8 shows the impact of\nTTL on a dynamic network with the parameters of Table 1\nand ρ = 0.03s. Clearly, low values of the TTL may con-\nstrain propagation too much, and negatively impact event\ndelivery. For instance, Figure 8 shows that in order to match\nthe event delivery we showed in Figure 7 for N = 300 and\nTTL=∞, we need to set TTL=14. Interestingly, with this\nvalue the curves with φ > 0 remain at about the same de-\nlivery rate, except for a small reduction with φ = 1, while\nthe purely probabilistic routing gets worse, with a reduction\nin delivery of about 20%. This is not surprising, given that\nthe deterministic approaches lead to routes that are signifi-\ncantly shorter, as we discussed earlier, and therefore are not\nsignificantly affected by the TTL limitation. Moreover, the\noverhead drops significantly, as we expected. For φ > 1,\noverhead is reduced of about 8%, while for the others re-\nduction is more significant, around 30%.\n","The simulation parameters are those of Figure 7. Results\nare in Figure 10, where we plot both the event delivery and\nthe number of forwarded events divided by the number of\npublished events. This latter metric characterizes the effort,\nin terms of forwarded events, required to deliver a single\nevent to a fixed set of receivers in a growing network6.\n","Density of Receivers vs. System Scale. In Figure 3 and 7\nwe analyzed event delivery and overhead when the scale\nis increased by adding new publishers and receivers to the\nsystem and showed that, despite the resulting heavy load,\nour approach still yields good performance. As a final di-\nmension of evaluation, it is worth investigating here how\nthe properties of our approach are affected by the density\nof receivers in the network.
