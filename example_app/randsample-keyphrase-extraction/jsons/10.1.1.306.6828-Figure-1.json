{"Caption":"Figure 1: Example capacity data for the prior 100 days. (Time = 0 is the most recent data.) The standard deviation is 6 thoughout the data.

Intuitively, the data indicates the \nsystem is going to reach 100% capacity within a few \ndays, but the regression line predicts far later (a false \nnegative). \n","The simplest method to  mitigate the issue illustrated \nin Figure 1 would be to choose a subset of recent data \nsuch as the prior 30 days.  This eliminates the \ninfluence of older data and improves the accuracy of \nthe model\u2019s predictions.  Unfortunately, using a fixed \nsubset to model all systems results in poor linear \nmodels for many systems.  Significantly more \naccurate models can be obtained by finding the \noptimal subset of data for each system and applying \nlinear regression to only  that subset of the data. \n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[448,418,750,506],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[454,131,701,391]}
