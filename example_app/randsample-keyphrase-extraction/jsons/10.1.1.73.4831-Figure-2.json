{"Caption":"Figure 2: Patch Correlations. On each image, the patches most correlated with the white-circled patch are shown. Notice that in the left image, where the patch sits in an area with a highly visible horizontal structure, the most correlated patches all lie along the horizontal features. Contrast this with the right image, showing correlation of patches with a patch sitting on a wheel, where the most correlated patches are those that strictly overlap the white- circled patch.
