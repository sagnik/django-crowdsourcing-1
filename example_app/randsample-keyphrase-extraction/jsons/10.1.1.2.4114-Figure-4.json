That suf\u0002ces because in\nmost practical applications it is very unlikely for a face to\nshow up only for fractions of a second in a video stream .\nAssume now that we are working at a frame rate f =\n25s\u00001. In order to scan the whole image three times a sec-\nond for new faces in all resolutions it suf\u0002ces to analyze\nonly one \u0002fth of all possible locations of the image pyramid\nat a time step k. This leads to the idea of slicing, where we\npartition the pyramid into parts of almost equal size. In this\nwork a single part is called a slice. In Fig. 4 shows how\nthe image pyramid is partitioned into 5 different slices (dis-\ntinguished by color). To formally introduce the partitioning\ninto \u0002ve slices we can rewrite Equ.
