now examine the relationship between request\nsizes and sequentiality. In Figure 3(a) and Figure 3(b) we\nplot the number of bytes transferred from a file against\nthe sequentiality of the transfer. This is measured using\nthe sequentiality metric: the fraction of bytes transferred\nsequentially, with values closer to one meaning higher\nsequentiality. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show this informa-\ntion in a heat map in which darker regions indicate a\nhigher fraction of transfers with that sequentiality met-\n","ric and lighter regions indicate a lower fraction. Each\nregion within the heat map represents a 10% range of the\nsequentiality metric. We see from Figures 3(a) and 3(b)\nthat small transfers and large transfers are more sequen-\ntial for read-only and write-only access, which is the case\nfor both workloads. However, medium-sized transfers,\nbetween 64KB and 4MB, are more random. For large\nand small transfers, file systems may be able to anticipate\nhigh sequentiality for read-only and write-only access.\nRead-write accesses, on the other hand, are much more\nrandom for most transfer sizes. Even very large read-\n","There have been a number of attempts to make layout,\ncaching, and prefetching decisions based on how specific\nfile types are accessed and the access patterns of certain\nusers [6, 17]. In this subsection, we take a closer at how\ncertain file types are accessed and the access patterns that\noccur between when a user begins a CIFS \u201Cuser session\u201D\nby logging on and when they log-off. Our emphasis is\non whether file types or users have common access pat-\nterns that can be exploited by the file system. We begin\nour analysis by breaking down file type frequencies for\nboth workloads. Figures 13(a) and 13(b) show the most\nfrequently opened and most frequently read and written\nfile types. For frequently read and written file types, we\nshow the fraction of bytes read for that type. Files with\nno discernible file extension are labeled \u201Cunknown.\u201D\n","ered highly sequential, 0.8\u20130.2 is considered mixed se-\nquentiality, and 0.19\u20130 is considered highly random. Fi-\nnally, access signatures are categorized by the number of\nbytes transferred; access signatures are considered small\nif they transfer no more than 100KB and large otherwise.\nDarker regions indicate the file type has a higher fraction\nof access signatures with those properties shown on the\ny-axis, and lighter regions indicate fewer signatures with\nthose characteristics.\nFigure 14 shows that most file types have several dis-\ntinct kinds of access patterns, rather than one as previ-\nously presumed. We also see that each type has multiple\npatterns that are more frequent than others, suggesting\nthat file systems may not be able to properly predict file\ntype access patterns using only a single pattern. Inter-\nestingly, small sequential read patterns occur frequently\nacross most of the file types, implying that file systems\nshould be optimized for this pattern, as is often already\ndone. Observation 11Most file types do not have a sin-\ngle pattern of access.\nSurprisingly, file types such as vmdk that consume a\nlarge fraction of total I\/Os are frequently accessed with\nsmall sequential reads. In fact, 91% of all vmdk ac-\ncesses are of this pattern, contradicting the intuition de-\nrived from Figure 13(b) that vmdk files have large ac-\ncesses. However, a much smaller fraction of vmdk ac-\ncesses transfer huge numbers of bytes in highly random\nread-write patterns.
