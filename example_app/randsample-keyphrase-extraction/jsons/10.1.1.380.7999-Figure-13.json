Figure 13 shows\nseveral such results, including a deformable volumetric case and a\ndeformable elongated case. Our algorithm works quite effectively,\ndespite its simplicity (by just using multiple samples per element).\nNote that our method is applicable to scenarios both physically\nplausible (e.g. Figure 13c) and implausible (e.g. 13d). As discussed\nin [Cho et al. 2007], physically implausible configurations are often\ndesired in real production scenarios. Figure 13 demonstrates poten-\ntial cases which cannot be produced by physical simulation (not sta-\nble) even with the assistance of frozen elements during piling [Hsu\nand Keyser 2010]. We have also found such complex elements very\ndifficult to synthesize well with only one sample per element as in\nour basic algorithm (see Figure 14) and prior data-driven element\nsynthesis methods which, to our knowledge, predominantly use a\nsingle sample per element.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":13,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[74,453,773,466],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[76,89,794,448]}
