{"Caption":"Figure 11. Sample detection results without any ﬁl- tering (red: shadow, green: foreground). ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["mark result since its performance for the above dataset\nwas comparatively poor. The graph SF (green) and\nSF+L shows the ROC curves for the proposed shadow\nﬂow method, and T, T+L are for the the benchmark\nmethod. As visible, the proposed algorithm doubled\nthe detection accuracy from 20% false-alarms on aver-\nage to 10% on average for most miss ratios. We also\nwant to point out that the benchmark method has a\nhard limit, i.e. it can not decrease the false alarms less\nthan 23% at the equal error rate. On the other hand,\nshadow ﬂow method achieves 15% for most of the pa-\nrameter assignments, and it always out performs the\nbenchmark method. In Fig. 11 we show sample shadow\ndetection results without clipping without any ﬁltering\nor morphological operations.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":11,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[96,368,393,398],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[78,98,410,347]}
