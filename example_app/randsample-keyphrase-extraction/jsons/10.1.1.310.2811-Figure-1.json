In this scenario, the\nAP backhaul bandwidth of the APs is shared among the\nstations. Next we will give some illustrative examples which\nshow the need for fairness and how greedy schemes, such\nas [2], fail.\nTopology unfairness. Consider the experiment2 depicted\nin Fig. 1(a), where stations A and B share 3 APs, each of\nthem having a 5 Mbps backhaul. The wireless speed from\neach station to the three APs is 20 Mbps. However, because\nof its location, station B has only two APs in range, while\nstation A can reliably connect to all the APs. A fair distri-\nbution of the aggregated AP backhaul would assign half of\nthe backhaul capacity \u2014 7.5 Mbps \u2014 to each station. Us-\ning a throughput maximization scheme as in [2], station B\nobtains 5 Mbps, almost half of the throughput of station A,\nwhich obtains more than 9 Mbps due to its better location\n(Fig. 1(b)).\nFlow distribution unfairness. Consider now the exper-\niment in Fig. 2(a), where stations A and B connect to two\nAPs with 5 Mbps backhauls. The wireless speed between the\nstations and the APs is 20 Mbps. Station B starts one down-\n","sulting in a total aggregated capacity of 12 Mbps. Given\nthat none of the stations is limited by the wireless links,\neach station is expected to get an average aggregated speed\nclose to 12\/3=4 Mbps, even if the stations share a different\nnumber of APs.\nThis is demonstrated in Fig. 10(b): the 3 stations obtain\na fair share of the aggregate AP backhaul speed, averaging\n3.80 Mbps, 3.89 Mbps and 3.75 Mbps on stations A, B and C,\nrespectively, for a total aggregate throughput of 11.44 Mbps,\nagain around the 95% of the overall available capacity.\nThen we consider the scenario in Fig. 11(a), where station\nB shares two AP backhauls with station A at wired speeds\nof 5 and 1 Mbps, respectively. Station A can also connect to\n","the 10 Mbps speed of AP3 backhaul.\nThe results in Fig. 11(b) show a total aggregate TCP\n","Let us recall the flow distribution unfairness example shown\nin Fig. 1(a) (Section 2) where two stations are sharing two\n5 Mbps backhaul APs and use an uneven number of TCP\nflows.
