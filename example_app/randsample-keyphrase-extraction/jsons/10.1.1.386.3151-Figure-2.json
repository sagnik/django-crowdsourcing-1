{"Caption":"Figure 2: Exhaustive approach in Juzi. Initially (a), the LinkedList is corrupt, as the first node contains value 4, which is incorrect according to the Figure 1 repOk correctness condition. Dotted lines show the first three repair attempts (b, c, d). Omitted are several subsequent repair attempts. Ultimately re- pair culminates in the correct list (z).
