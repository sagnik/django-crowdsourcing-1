Consistent with H4, the impact of both shared \nvisual space and chat persistence on performance was larger \nwhen the verbal task was more complex. The Shared Visual \nSpace × Lexical Complexity interaction showed that the \nshared visual space was more useful when the blocks were \ndifficult to describe Plaids rather than easy to describe \nSolids (for the interaction F(1,226)=22.56, p<.001). \nSimilarly, the Chat Persistence × Lexical Complexity \ninteraction (see Figure 3; for the interaction \nF(1,226)=11.55, p<.001) showed that the longer dialogue \nhistory only improved performance for the difficult to \ndescribe plaids (Persistence: 167.3 sec vs. No Persistence: \n201.8 sec; F(1,226)=20.67, p<.001) and not for the easy to \ndescribe solids (Persistence: 105.7 sec vs. No Persistence: \n103.7 sec; F(1,226)=.07, ns).
