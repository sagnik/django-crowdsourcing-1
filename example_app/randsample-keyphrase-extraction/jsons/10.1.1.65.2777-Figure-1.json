{"Caption":"Figure 1. An illustration of parallel coordinates","ImageText":[],"Mention":["This section presents a brief review of the parallel coordinate \nmethod [7] for visualizing multi-variable data in a 2D space. In \nthis approach, a separate vertical axis is assigned to each variable. \nMultiple vertical axes, i.e., one for each of the coordinates \n(variables) of the data set, are arranged at an equal distance from \neach other along the horizontal axis. For each data point (or \nrecord), a coordinate value is plotted along its respective vertical \naxis. The coordinate values for a given data point for two adjacent \nvertical axes are connected with straight lines. In this way, an n-\nvariable data record can be visualized as a polygonal line drawn \nacross the n parallel vertical axes with n-1 line segments. Figure 1 \ndepicts a data set with nine 6-variable data records.  \n","At this point, the engineers have a set of rules from a data mining \ntool. These rules are loaded into V-Miner, and the user can select \nthe rules to be used from Figure 11.  \n"],"Page":3,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[114,336,368,352],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[78,172,402,318]}
