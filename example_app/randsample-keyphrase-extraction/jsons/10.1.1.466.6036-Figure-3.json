The\nEIGs of all subject applications were obtained using reverse\nengineering. To addressQ1 above, the number of test cases\nrequired to test 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-way interactions was com-\nputed. The result for each application is shown as a solid\nline in Figure 3 (the y-axis in all these plots is a logarithmic\nscale). The plot shows that the number of test cases grows\nexponentially with the number of interactions. The number\nquickly becomes unmanageable for more than 2- and 3-way\ninteractions. In this study, only two-way interactions were\ntested by the seed test suites. The seed test suites contained\n920, 51,316, 29,033, and 4634 test cases for Crossword-\nSage, FreeMind, GanttProject, and JMSN, respectively.\n","CrosswordSage, FreeMind, GanttProject, and JMSN, re-\nspectively. The GUI's run-time state was recorded during\ntest execution. All faults were \u0002xed in the applications.\nSTEP 4: Generation of the ESIG. The above feedback\nwas used to obtain the ESIs for each application. To ad-\ndress Q2, the number of ESI relationships in which each\nevent participates is shown in Figure 4. Each event in the\nGUI has been assigned a unique integer ID; all event IDs\nare shown on the x-axis. The y-axis shows the number of\nESI relationships in which the event participates. The result\nshows that certain events dominate (around 25%) the ESI\nrelationship in GUIs. In the future, we will create a classi\u0002-\ncation of these dominant events.\nThe ESIs were used to obtain the ESIGs and, subse-\nquently, additional test cases. The number of test cases re-\nquired to test 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-way interactions using an\nESIG is shown, for each application, as a dotted line in\nFigure 3. This result shows that the growth of the ESIG-\ngenerated test cases appears manageable for 3-, 4-, and\n(given suf\u0002cient resources) 5-way interactions. They are in\nfact reduced from the EIG by 99.78%, 99.97%, and 99.99%\nfor 3-, 4-, and 5-way interactions, respectively. In this study,\ntest cases for 3-, 4-, and 5-way interactions were generated.\nThe total number of test cases for these interactions was\n3592, 160,629, 199,127, and 18,144 for CrosswordSage,\nFreeMind, GanttProject, and JMSN, respectively.\nSTEP 5: Execution of the test cases. To address Q3, all\nthe newly-generated test cases were executed. The execu-\ntion lasted for several days. In all, 68, 157, 109, and 20\ntest cases caused crashes; they were caused by 3, 3, 3, and\n1 faults for CrosswordSage, FreeMind, GanttProject, and\nJMSN, respectively. These faults had not been detected by\nthe two-way test cases. The result shows that the ESIG-\nbased test cases help to detect additional faults.\nThis study demonstrated that test suites for multi-way\nGUI event interactions are able to detect additional faults\ncompared to two-way interactions. In earlier work, we\nhave shown that two-way interactions yield high code cov-\nerage, while multi-way interactions cover little additional\n"],"Page":7,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[68,316,398,376],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[99,101,369,311]}
