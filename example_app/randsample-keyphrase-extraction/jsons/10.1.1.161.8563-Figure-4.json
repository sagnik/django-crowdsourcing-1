{"Caption":"Figure 4: Deciding on how to treat 1-M and M-1 relationships. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["It is obvious that no discernible relationship can be found\nwith the tokens in the chosen positions. Token 3552 (in\nposition 3) maps to tokens 3552 (in position 4) and 3534.\nOn the other hand token 3311 also maps to token 3534, this\nmakes it impossible to split these messages using their token\nrelationships. It is a scenario like this that we refer to as a\nM-M relationship.\nIn the case of 1-M and M-1 relations, the M side of the\nrelation could represent variable values (so we are dealing\nwith only one line format) or constant values (so each value\nactually represents a different line format). The diagram in\nFig. 4 describes the simple heuristic that we developed to\ndeal with this problem. Using the ratio between the num-\nber of unique values in the set and the number of lines that\nhave these values in the corresponding token position in the\npartition, and two threshold values, a decision is made on\nwhether to treat the M side as consisting of constant values\nor variable values. M-M relationships are iteratively split\ninto separate 1-M relationships or ignored depending on if\nthe partition is coming from Step-1 or Step-2 of the parti-\ntioning process respectively.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,597,772,625],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[459,414,792,573]}
