From the results, we can see that the proposed\nsupervised ensemble ranking (SER) method outperforms\nthe RankBoost, AdaRank, and MHR-BC methods, but is\nslightly worse than the ranking SVM approach. Among all\ncompared methods, the proposed semi-supervised ensem-\nble ranking (SSER) method achieved the best MAP perfor-\nmance, outperforming all of the state-of-the-art approaches\nin our comparisons. This shows that the proposed scheme is\neffective for improving the retrieval performance.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,536,406,569],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[80,328,404,532]}
