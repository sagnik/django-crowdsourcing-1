As\nexpected, the soliton does not change shape before it hits the right boundary,\nbut it starts to decay as soon as the solution reaches the right boundary.\nOn the left of Figure 4 is the evolution of the weighted L2-norm of the\nKdV solution. One can see that after the soliton hits the right boundary, the\nweighted L2-norm of the solution starts to decay exponentially as proved in\n","Theorem 4.4. For the sake of comparison, the evolution of the standard L2-\nnorm of the KdV solution is presented in the right of Figure 4.
