In psycholog-\nical experiments subjective complexity is measured\nin terms of the rate and accuracy of learning an arti-\nficial category defined by some (usually visual) fea-\ntures such as color, size, shape, and so on. This\nfinding appears to be consistent with the complex-\nity of isomorphic phonological and morphological\nlinguistic patterns as suggested by typological stud-\nies not discussed here for reasons of space (Mielke,\n2004; Cysouw, 2003; Clements, 2003; Moreton and\nPertsova, 2012). Morphological patterns isomorphic\nto those in figure 1 appear in figure 2.\n","A study by Gottwald (1971) found interesting dif-\nferences in the subjective complexity of learning\npatterns in figure 1 depending on whether the data\nwas presented to subjects as learning a single cat-\negory (stimuli were labeled A vs. ¬A) or whether\nit was presented as learning two distinct categories\n(the same stimuli were labeled A vs. B). Follow-\ning this study, I refer to learning a single category as\n\u201Cbiased labeling\u201D (abbreviated b) and learning sev-\neral categories as \u201Cneutral labeling\u201D (abbreviated n).\nObserve that since the AND\/OR category divides the\nstimuli into unequal sets, it has two different biased\nversions: one biased towards AND and one biased\ntowards OR (as demonstrated in table 1).
