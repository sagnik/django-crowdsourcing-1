These RTTs\nwill include in them queuing delays incurred on the incom-\ning and outgoing DSL link to Alice\u2019s house, thus leaking\ninformation about the queue sizes on those links, which can\nin turn reveal traffic patterns for Alice.\nThe question is, then, how much information is leaked\nby this channel? The probe packets traverse many Internet\nlinks, and the queuing delays on Alice\u2019s DSL link are but\none component of the RTT. To investigate this question, we\ncarried out a simple test with a home user in Illinois down-\nloading the www.yahoo.com home page, while a computer in\nNew Jersey sent ping request to the public IP address of\nthe home user at a rate of 100 pings per second. The re-\nsults are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2(a) plots the volume\nof the home user\u2019s real traffic binned into 10ms intervals.\nFigure 2(b) plots the RTTs of the ping requests. We see\nthat the RTTs are highly correlated with the HTTP traf-\nfic; whenever there is a large peak in the user\u2019s traffic, the\nattacker observer correspondingly large RTTs.\nWe model the incoming DSL link as a FIFO queue. For\neach ping request, the RTT (mainly queuing delay) depends\non the total volume of the user\u2019s packets (traffic pattern).\nWe can get the following recursive algorithm for recovery of\ntraffic patterns from the RTT observations:\n","of the processing delays experienced by the probe packets\nwhen there is no congestion. Figure 2(c) shows the process-\ning result of RTTs in Figure 2(b).\n"],"Page":2,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[447,588,762,601],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[461,81,750,570]}
