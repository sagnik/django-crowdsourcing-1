{"Caption":"Figure 10: Micro-benchmarks: CPU (RC5), read (retrieve), and write (store) energy consumption measured at four different voltage levels. Although the RC5 and retrieve test cases consume less energy at low voltage, this is not the case for the store test case (a write-intensive application) as the savings due to running the chip at low voltage does not compensate for the en- ergy cost required to correct errors.
