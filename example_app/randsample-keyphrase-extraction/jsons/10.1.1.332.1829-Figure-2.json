{"Caption":"Figure 2: Examples of the most-stable-over-scales methods. A centered 1D Gaussian signal of  2 = 2 with additive ran- dom noise (udqgq   0=01) is used as target. At each analy- sis scale, the variance of the target is estimated from a set of samples within: (a) ±0.1 , (b) ±1.0 , and (c) ±3.0 . Dash lines: the ground-truth scale. Dot lines: the ﬁrst-order es- timates by Eq.(14). Solid lines: the second-order estimates by Eq.(15). \u201C+\u201D and \u201C×\u201D denote the most stable estimates by the ﬁrst- and second-order methods, respectively.
