In the figure, if the branch is\ntaken, memory is modified at the location given by R[2].\nIf the branch is not taken, the value of R[2] must be differ-\nent than the value of the register had the branch been taken.\nTherefore, inserting code to restrict the labelMem[R[2]]\nif the branch is not taken will modify the label of a different\nmemory location than if the branch were taken. If R[2] is\nbimodal (i.e. it only takes on one of two values), then it will\nstill be possible to distinguish between what path was taken\nby analyzing the appropriate location in memory.\n"],"Page":9,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[96,151,369,166],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[69,98,377,143]}
