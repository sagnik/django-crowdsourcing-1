"Caption": "Figure 6: 15 most populated clusters found by the various al- gorithms in descending order of E[Ni ]. Algorithms were trained on a random subset of 10,000 images from MNIST and dimen- sionality reduced to 50 dimensions using PCA. Log probability of 10,000 test images are given by, L = −574.05 ± 0.52 (TSB), L = −574.03 ± 0.53 (O-TSB), L = −573.90 ± 0.54 (CTSB), L = −573.89 ± 0.54 (O-CTSB), L = −574.06 ± 0.50 (FSD), and L = −573.89 ± 0.51 (CFSD). Standard error over differences relative to O-CTSB are given by: dL = −0.17 ± 0.13 (TSB), dL = −0.14 ± 0.11 (O-TSB), dL = −0.01 ± 0.05 (CTSB), dL = −0.17 ± 0.13 (FSD), and dL = −0.00 ± 0.10 (CFSD).
