{"Caption":"Figure 7: The Amazon Mechanical Turk interface for shading (left), and nine randomly selected generated shadings (middle). The average (near right) and median (far right) of all of the shadings are visually pleasing despite the low quality of any individual shading. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["(Figure 7, left). By initializing the canvas with the outline\nof the pear, we hoped to avoid the need to register subjects\u2019\npaintings during analysis.\n","A representative selection of paintings created by the sub-\njects is shown in Figure 7, middle. 23 of the 50 subjects\nfilled the entire pear with a single shade of grey (13 chose\nblack). All but one subject generally adhered to the outline\nof the pear.\nAssuming that subjects\u2019 paintings are already registered\n(due to the outline of the pear), it is natural to apply pixel-\nwise aggregation operations. The pixel-wise average and the\npixel-wise median can be seen in Figure 7, right. As with\ndrawing, aggregation has produced a result that is clearly\nsuperior to any of the inputs. The average is perhaps overly\nsmoothed and produces paint outside the outline of the pear.\nThe median is higher-contrast and has no such painting-\noutside-the-line artifacts.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":7,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,293,775,338],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[86,73,748,278]}
