Because many\nMSCs are capable of processing up to 500K calls\/hour, we engi-\nneer our solution to be robust to large spikes in traffic. We therefore\nallow SMS traffic to use 6 of the 12 total SDCCHs, which yields\na blocking probability of 1% of voice calls by the SDCCH when\nvoice traffic requests reach 250, 000 calls\/hour. (Note that calls\nwould experience an average blocking probability of 71% due to a\nlack of TCHs with requests at this intensity.) Because these net-\nworks are designed to operate dependably during elevated traffic\nconditions, we believe that the above settings are realistic.\nThe blocking probabilities for SMS and voice flows in a sector\nimplementing SRP are shown in Figure 11. Because SRP prevents\ntext messages from competing for all possible SDCCHs, voice calls\nexperience no blocking on the SDCCHs throughout the duration of\nthe attack. Text messages, however, are blocked at a rate of 83%.\nChannel utilization, illustrated in Figure 12, gives additional in-\nsight into network conditions. Because calling behavior remains\nthe same during the attack, the resources allocated by the network\n"],"Page":10,"Number":11,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[103,312,377,326],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[83,78,399,302]}
