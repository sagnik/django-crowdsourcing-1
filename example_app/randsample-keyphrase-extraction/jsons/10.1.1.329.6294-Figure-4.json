Each \npair specifies a default formatting for \nconstituents in the category, specifically whether \ntheir sub-constituents are to be aligned vertically, \nor concatenated relative to a marked point, with \nsubsequent children indented.  These defaults are \nused in the absence of overriding factors such as \ncoordination.   \nThe directives used are very simple ones, \nbecause the simpler the formatting rules, the \nmore likely it is that outputs can be accurately \nchecked for correctness, and edited conveniently \nIt is assumed that the parser output either \nincludes conventional parse trees, or that such \ntrees can be derived from the output.  This \nassumption covers many grammatical \napproaches, such as CG, HPSG, LFG, and TAG.  \nThe logical configuration implied by these \ninputs is shown in Figure 4. It includes a parser-\nspecific adaptor to convert parser-output trees \ninto a standard form.  The adaptor need not be \nvery large; for the hybrid parser it consists of \nabout 75 lines of Java code. \nThe subsections below discuss the standard \nParseTree form, the directives that have been \nidentified to date and their formatting effects, \nand the treatment of coordination.   \n"],"Page":5,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[228,767,415,783],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[109,311,229,785]}
