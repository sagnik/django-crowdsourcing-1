{"Caption":"Figure 7: Ramp metering at the freeway A13 in Delft, The Netherlands. One car may pass per green phase. To prevent red-light running the control is enforced. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Ramp metering is one of the most investigated and applied freeway traffic control measures. A ramp\nmetering set-up is implemented as a traffic signal that is placed at the on-ramp of a freeway as shown\nin Figure 7. The required metering rate is implemented by appropriately choosing the phase lengths of\nthe traffic signal. Several ramp metering implementations can be distinguished [21], e.g., single-lane with\none vehicle per green ramp metering, single-lane with multiple vehicles per green ramp metering (bulk\nmetering), and dual-lane ramp metering.\nRamp metering can be used in two modes: the traffic spreading mode and the traffic restricting mode.\nIn the traffic spreading mode ramp metering smoothens the merging process of on-ramp traffic by breaking\nthe platoons and by spreading the on-ramp traffic demand over time as observed by Elefteriadou [34].\nThis mitigates the shock waves that can occur under high traffic density conditions. In this application the\nmetering rate equals the average arrival rate of the vehicles.\nRestrictive ramp metering can be used for three different purposes:\n"],"Page":13,"Number":7,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[116,525,709,556],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[175,150,651,508]}
