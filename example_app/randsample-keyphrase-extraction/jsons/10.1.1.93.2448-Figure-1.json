{"Caption":"Figure 1: Public and private IP address domains","ImageText":[],"Mention":["The combined pressures of tremendous growth and mas-\nsive security challenges have forced the Internet\u2019s archi-\ntecture to evolve in ways that make life difficult for many\napplications. The Internet\u2019s original uniform address ar-\nchitecture, in which every node has a globally unique IP\naddress and can communicate directly with every other\nnode, has been replaced with a new de facto Internet ad-\ndress architecture, consisting of a global address realm\nandmany private address realms interconnected by NATs.\nIn this new address architecture, illustrated in Figure 1,\nonly the nodes in the \u201Cmain,\u201D global address realm can be\neasily contacted from anywhere in the network, because\nonly they have unique, globally routable IP addresses.\nNodes on private IP networks can connect to other nodes\non the same private network, and they can usually initi-\nate TCP or UDP connections to \u201Cwell-known\u201D nodes in\nthe global address realm, because NATs on the path will\ncreate temporary address and port mappings for that out-\ngoing connection and translate the IP addresses and port\nnumbers in packets crossing the NAT. NATs usually block\nall incoming traffic unless specifically configured to do\notherwise.\n"],"Page":2,"Number":1,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[124,447,392,461],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[110,100,408,430]}
