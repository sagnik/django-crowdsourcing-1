8. The TREC Terabyte data was not used due to\nthe fact that in TREC Terabyte the actual value of average\nprecision is not known since complete judgments are not\navailable.\nTo simulate the setup used in TREC Terabyte, we first\nform different depth-k pools where k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10,\n20, 30, 40, 50} and obtain judgments for all documents in\neach one of these pools. Then, for each value of k, we com-\npute the total number of documents that are in the depth-k\npool and we randomly sample equal number of documents\nfrom the complete judgment set2 excluding the depth-k pool.\nAfter forming these two sets of judgments (depth-k and ran-\ndom) we combine them and compute xinfAP on these com-\nbined judgments.\nThis setup exactly corresponds to a sampling strategy\nwhere complete judgments are divided into two strata and\njudgments are formed by uniformly and independently sam-\npling within each stratum.\nNote that in TREC, there are some systems that were\nsubmitted but that did not contribute to the pool. To fur-\nther evaluate the quality of our estimators in terms of their\nrobustness for evaluating the quality of unseen systems (sys-\ntems that did not contribute to the pool), when we form the\nincomplete relevance judgments, we only consider the sys-\ntems that contribute to the pool but we compute the xinfAP\nestimates for all submitted systems.\nFigure 2 demonstrates how xinfAP computed using judg-\nments generated by combining (left) depth-10, (middle) depth-\n5 and (right) depth-1 pools with equal number of randomly\nsampled judgments compares with the actual AP. Each of\nthese depths correspond to judging 23.1%, 12.7% and 3.5%\nof the entire pool, respectively. The plots report the RMS er-\nror (how accurate are the estimated values?), the Kendall\u2019s\nτ value (how accurate are the estimated rankings of sys-\ntems?) and the linear correlation coefficient, ρ, (how well\ndo the estimated values fit in a straight line compared to\nthe actual values?). The dot signs in the figures refer to the\nsystems that were used to create the original pools and the\nplus signs refer to the systems that did not contribute to the\npool.\nThe results illustrated in these plots reinforce our claims\nthat xinfAP is an unbiased estimator of average precision.\nFurthermore, it can be seen that the measure can reliably be\nused to evaluate the quality of systems that were not used\nto create the initial samples, hence the measure is robust to\nevaluating the quality of unseen systems.\nFigure 3 illustrates how xinfAP computed on a non-random\njudgment set compares with infAP computed on a random\njudgment set for various levels of incompleteness. In a sim-\nilar manner to the experimental setup of the original infAP\nwork, for each value of k, we generated ten different sample\ntrials according to the procedure described in the previous\nparagraph, and for each one of the ten trials we computed\nthe xinfAP for all systems. Then, all three statistics were\ncomputed for each one of the trials and the averages of these\nstatistics over all ten trials were reported for different levels\nof judgment incompleteness. Using the same procedure, we\nalso created ten different sample trials where the samples\nwere generated by merely randomly sampling the judgment\n"],"Page":6,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,485,772,542],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[83,301,755,470]}
