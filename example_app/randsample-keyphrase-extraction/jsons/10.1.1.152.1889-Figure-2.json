This lends credence to our claims that the\ntrends are real.\nWe averaged each evaluation measure over subjects and\ntopics at each accuracy level. To test significance, we per-\nformed Student t-tests between all pairs of accuracy levels\n(e.g. 50 and 60, 50 and 70, ...). In general, the significance\nnumbers should be taken with a grain of salt\u2014as stated\nearlier, sources of variance are not clear.\nStatistical analysis might be influenced by factors such as\nsubjects getting better due to \u201Clearning the system\u201D, sub-\njects having prior knowledge of a topic, or subjects getting\ntired and less effective towards the end of a session. We hope\nthat randomization of topic presentation mitigates these fac-\ntors.\nFigure 2 shows a decrease in subject time on task as sys-\ntem retrieval accuracy improves. At passage accuracy 50,\naverage time on task was about 58 minutes, with high vari-\nance. At passage accuracy 98, average time on task was\nabout 40 minutes, a 31% decrease. The difference in time\nis significant at α = 0.95 between 50 and 93, 60 and 90, 80\nand 93, 85 and 93, and 93 and 98. At α = 0.9 we have sig-\nnificance between 50 and 80, which suggests that with more\ndata we could claim greater significance.\nFigure 3 shows an increase in recall from 0.38 to 0.56 as\nsystem accuracy improves. Several topics gave subjects a\n\u201Chint\u201D about how many facets they should be able to find,\nbut even on these topics average recall was fairly low. Dif-\nference in recall is significant at α = 0.95 between 50 and\n80 and above, and between 90 and 98. At α = 0.9, the\ndifference is significant between 50 and 60.\nFigure 4 shows recall per time (multiplied by 100). As\nthe figure shows, it is fairly constant from passage accuracy\nlevels 60 to 90, but increases steeply from 50 to 60 and from\n90 to 98. At α = 0.95, the difference is significant between\n50 and 60 (and above), between 90 and 93, and between 98\nand 90 (and below).\nFigure 5 shows a slight decrease in \u201Cerrors\u201D (disagree-\nments). In general, it decreases where Figure 4 increases.\nNone of the differences are significant at α = 0.95.\nWhen judging subjects against the second, unused anno-\n"],"Page":6,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[460,325,750,338],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[453,80,757,297]}
