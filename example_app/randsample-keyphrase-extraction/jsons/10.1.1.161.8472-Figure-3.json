For this, we\ncalculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the\nnumber of wall posts for each user pair in Figure 3. We\nobserve a significant skew in the distribution. The median\nnumber of posts per user pair is 2 and 81% of the pairs\nexchange no more than 5 wall posts. However, some user\npairs (<1%) exchanged more then 100 posts. In fact, the\nmost active pair exchanged 767 total wall posts in the first\nyear the link was established.\nUser pairs with low number of wall posts may be casual\nacquaintances in Facebook, while user pairs who generated\nhigh rates of wall posts may represent close friends. Like-\nwise, different wall posting rates may indicate that the rela-\ntionship between individuals evolve with different patterns.\n"],"Type":"Figure","Number":3,"Page":3,"CaptionBB":[438,235,772,262],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[443,80,752,225]}
