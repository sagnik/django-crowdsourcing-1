Users\nwere warned that talking and laughing may be interpreted as\na discrete sound. They were also warned that the robot has\nhard-coded limits on its motion, so if the arm stops moving\ndownward, it may be at its ground limit.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":12,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[100,301,379,313],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[138,72,343,282]}
