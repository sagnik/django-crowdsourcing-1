The Nokia N900 is a more\nrecent model than N810 and has significantly more pow-\nerful processing capabilities. Even though the N900 lo-\ncal processing takes a bit higher power, the shorter pro-\ncessing time makes the N900 more energy efficient for\nthis workload. For the WLAN case both devices perform\nsimilarly regardless of the better WLAN throughput that\nN900 is able to achieve.\nIn the web browsing case, we compared local browser\nwith remote X11 client browser. As an example, open-\ning the English main page of wikipedia (http:\/\/en.\nwikipedia.org\/) requires about 30 joules with the\nN900 local browser and about 25 joules with a remote\nbrowser over WLAN connection. The CNN Interna-\ntional Edition page (http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/)\ntakes roughly the same energy (60J) with local and re-\nmote browser. Even though web page processing re-\nquires significant computation, and is therefore a good\ncandidate for offloading, the remote web browser causes\nalso significant amounts of network traffic while render-\ning the page.\nFigure 4 shows example curves of the download traffic\nfor local and remote browser cases while viewing the En-\nglish main page of wikipedia on N900. Even though the\nlocal browser downloads less data (about 200KB) than\nthe remote case (about 500KB), the remote browser case\nachieves higher throughput for a large part of the data\ntransfer. This highlights the fact that the amount of trans-\nferred data alone is not a sufficient metric for character-\nizing the energy consumption of communication. As dis-\ncussed in Section 3, the communication pattern is also an\nimportant consideration.\nFor X11 applications, the usage pattern and applica-\n"],"Page":5,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[114,329,396,343],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[117,108,397,310]}
