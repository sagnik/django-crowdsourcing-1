As it can be seen in that figure, the use of multiple\nreference frames improves the reference distortion and re-\nduces the bit-rate slightly, being therefore the expected re-\nsult. In terms of error-resilience there is a monotonous dis-\ntortion decrease and a degradation of 1 dB is achieved by\nusing 5 reference frames instead of just 1.\nSince this result was unexpected according to [5], we\ncompleted our analysis by evaluating the performance of\nthis parameter in the situation it was originally proposed\nfor: entire frame losses. Instead of running a high mobility\nscenario (known to cause that kind of losses), we have di-\nrectly tested the effects of loosing 1 to 5 consecutive frames,\nso that the error propagation effect was presented as clearly\nas possible.\nThe results found again point to using one reference\nframe in order to obtain the best performance, recovering\nfrom error up to 10 times faster comparing with the use\nof 5 reference frames. A proper tuning choice for H.264\nin MANETs would be, therefore, to use only one reference\nframe; demands in terms of memory on both encoder and\ndecoder are also reduced by this setup.\nConcerning intra-updating of macroblocks, H.264 pro-\nvides several choices to the user. We have evaluated the\nmain available choices in the reference software, which are:\n"],"Page":5,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[455,531,752,562],"Height":1169,"Width":826,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[438,350,771,529]}
