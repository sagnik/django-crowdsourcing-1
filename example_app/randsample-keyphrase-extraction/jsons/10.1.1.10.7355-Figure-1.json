{"Caption":"Figure 1: Performance of value iteration using state aggregation, with and without approximation. Each point represents data at the end of an iteration. The top graph shows the error bound at each iteration, and the bottom graph shows the average number of aggre- gated states at each iteration. Note that value iteration with exact state aggregation did not finish the last iteration after 600 seconds.
