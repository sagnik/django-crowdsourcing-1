Figure 2 gives the highlights. Users\n","During download (checkout) operations, the client\ncode will search through the existing version(s) of the\nuser\u2019s data on that client to identify chunks that need not\nbe retrieved from the server. As the system is only com-\nparing the latest version on the server with the existing\nversion on the client, the volume of data to be transmit-\nted does not depend on the privacy policy. In contrast,\nthe volume of data transmitted during upload (checkout)\noperations does depend on the privacy policy employed\nbecause, at the server, redundant chunks are only identi-\nﬁed within that user\u2019s version history under the IP policy,\nbut can be identiﬁed acrosss all users\u2019 version histories\nunder the ALL policy. These differences based on stor-\nage policy are summarized in Figure 9 and affect our dis-\ncussion in two ways: (1) this section (Section 5.1), which\ninvestigates the effects of privacy policy, only considers\nthe upload operation, and (2) Figures 12 and 13 in Sec-\ntion 5.2 contain curves simply labeled CAS that repre-\nsent the identical download behaviors of the IP and ALL\npolicies.\n","Chunk size dramatically affects demand-fetch.\nMoving to a smaller chunk size can have a signiﬁcant\neffect on the volume of data transmitted during a down-\nload operation, particularly if compression is not used, as\nshown in Figure 12. The average download size, in par-\nticular, is reduced by a factor of two (for Delta) to four\n","Caching improves demand-fetch. To evaluate the ef-\nfect of client-side caching on demand-fetch download\nvolume, we calculated how much data would need to\nbe transferred from the server to a client under various\nconditions and collected those results in Figure 12. The\ncurve labeled \u201CNo-cache\u201D depicts the volume of data that\nwould be transmitted if no data from the previous ver-\nsion of the parcel were present in the client cache. Un-\nder the \u201CDelta\u201D policy, the chunks in the memory image\nare compared with the same chunks (those at the same\noffset within the image) in the previous version of the\nmemory image to determine whether they match. The\n","searches all the data cached on the client (memory and\ndisk) to identify chunks that are already present on the\nclient. Each basic curve in Figure 12 also has a com-\npanion curve depicting the download volumes observed\nwhen compression is employed during the transfer.\n","As shown in Figure 12(a), introducing a differencing\nmechanism (either Delta or CAS) yields a reduction of\napproximately 20% (for the 128 KB chunk size) in the\ndownload size relative to the size when no cached copy\nis present. Using compression alone, however, is very\neffective\u2013 reducing the transfer size from 256 MB to ap-\nproximately 75 MB in the absence of caching. Lever-\naging cached data in addition to compression yields a\n","The basic tools are the same as those mentioned for\ndemand-fetch mode. That is, a cache of at least one pre-\nvious version of the parcel is maintained at the client, if\npossible. Redundancy between the cached version and\nthe current version on the server is identiﬁed and only\nnon-redundant chunks are transferred during the down-\nload. Further, the transferred chunks are (optionally)\ncompressed prior to transmission. One difference be-\ntween our treatment of demand-fetch and complete-fetch\nis that the CAS policy for complete-fetch mode always\ncompares the entire current server version with the entire\ncached client version. Consequently, Figure 13 includes\na single \u201CCAS\u201D curve rather than the separate \u201CM\u201D and\n\u201CM+D\u201D curves of Figure 12.\n"],"Page":3,"Number":2,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[130,986,379,1000],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[119,801,393,975]}
