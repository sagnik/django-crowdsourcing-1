{"Caption":"Figure 15: (a)-(b) query execution times for range queries on gear and circle. (c) Query execution times for point queries. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["trend appears in the results for point queries, Section 7.2).\nThe cube and heartmeshes contain more regular elements (in\nterms of size\/geometry), characteristics that help the perfor-\nmance of the HRTree. The gear, circle and quake datasets\nare representative of the real meshes used in applications:\nIn practice only certain regions of the domain are \u201Crefined\u201D\n(modeled with large numbers of tiny elements), which leads\nto significant irregularities in the mesh structure.\nThe number of Elements pages accessed by DLS is compa-\nrable to that of the HRTree, even for the 10% queries. Due\nto the effectiveness of our compression technique, the ad-\nditional connectivity information does not deteriorate I\/O\nperformance. For all the \u201Csmall\u201D ranges (1%) DLS accesses\n1-3 fewer pages than the HRTree, corresponding to a re-\nduction of up to 48%. This happens because the R-Tree\naccesses leaf pages whose MBR intersects the query range,\nbut do not contain a result. The impact of this imprecision\ndecreases for larger ranges, as it is more likely that a leaf\npage will actually contain an element intersecting the query\nrange and is anyway needed by the query.\nThe overall performance improvement offered by DLS ran-\nges from 28% to up to a significant factor of 4 (circle, 1%).\nThe circle dataset benefits from DLS the most, with im-\nprovements of 36% up to a factor of 4.\nFigure 15 (a), (b) shows the query execution times for the\nsame workloads on the gear and circle datasets.
