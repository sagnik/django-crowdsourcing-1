Masse et al. \ndiscussed other location estimators, e.g., Tukey median, \n","the n object points inside a crowded region are candidates. \nHowever, the center defined by spatial median may lie on \nthe boundary for some concave shapes (Fig. 4 (middle)). As \nwe have discussed in the previous section, skeletons are \noften defined as \u201Ccenter lines\u201D or \u201Cmedial axes\u201D. Therefore, \nvisual centeredness, i.e., skeletons should not lie on the \nboundary of the object, is often desirable. \nWe introduce a Valence Normalized Spatial Median \n(VNSM) algorithm to compute the center of a crowded \nregion. The key concept is to normalize by the valence of a \npoint (vertex), giving us: \n","penalizes boundary points which have smaller valences \nthan interior points. As a result, the estimated center is \nattracted towards the middle of the region (Fig. 4 (right)).  \nTo reduce computational cost of computing square root \nfor Euclidean distance and division we modify Equation (2) \nto Equation (3). Since n is a constant, removing n does not \naffect the value for which the expression attains its \nminimum. \n","Fig. 4 (right) shows the center obtained by using VNSM. \n","We also tested our approach on various poses of the \nsame model. Fig. 14 shows several models that were \nmodified to represent different poses, along with their \nskeletons. Depending on the extent of difference between \nposes, our algorithm produced a small dissimilarity \nmeasure for the different models. For example, chain code \nbased measure gives scores between 0.06 and 0.19 for \nvarious poses of 3D shapes, like the ones shown in Fig. 14, \nshowing some ability to discriminate between the pairs. \nWhereas, a measure based on graph structure and relative \nlengths of segments produces scores of 0\u2019s for both. \n"],"Page":3,"Number":4,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,816,428,871],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[105,724,789,817]}
