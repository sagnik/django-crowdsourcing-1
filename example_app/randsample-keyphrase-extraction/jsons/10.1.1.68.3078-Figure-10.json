{"Caption":"Figure 10. Three rendered views of the recon- structed trihedron. Note that the object was reconstructed only from two highly distorted omnidirectional images (as in Fig. 9). ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Two images of the trihedron were taken by positioning \nour calibrated camera at two unknown different loca-\ntions (see Fig. 9). Then, several point matches were \npicked manually from both views of the object and the \neight point algorithm [17] was applied. In order to \nobtain good reconstruction results, more than eight \npoints (actually 135) were extracted. Then, the coordi-\nnates of the correspondent 3D vectors, back-projected \ninto the space, were normalized according to the non-\nuniform mirror resolution. The results of the recon-\nstruction are shown in Fig. 10, where we used checker \npatches to fit the reconstructed 3D points (red rounds). \nIn order to compare the results with the ground truth, \nwe computed the angles between the three planes fit-\nting the reconstructed points. We found the following \nvalues: 94.6°, 86.8° and 85.3°. Moreover, the average \ndistances of these points from the fitted planes were \nrespectively 0.05 cm, 0.75 cm and 0.07 cm. Finally, \nsince we knew the size of each checker to be 6.0 cm x \n6.0 cm, we also calculated the dimension of every \nreconstructed checker, and we found an average error \nof 0.29 cm. \n"],"Page":7,"Number":10,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,700,409,764],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[103,354,417,685]}
