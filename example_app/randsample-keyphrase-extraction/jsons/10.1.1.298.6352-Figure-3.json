{"Caption":"Figure 3. The thick circles represent the nodes within the worm- hole range, those on two sides correspond to W0 and W1 respec- tively. The physical wormhole link is not shown since it is not vis- ible in the network connectivity. The darkly shaded region denotes the ball B1 (p), which includes all nodes in W1 . Thus removing B1 (p) also removes all wormhole edges. The lightly shaded region denotes the ring N[1,2] (p). It has two components, one near W0 and one near W1 .
