{"Caption":"Figure 4: (a) A constraint is placed on a mirror, which reflects only a small part of the dragon. The constraint visualizes how the green point is reflected at the position of the red point. (b) Moving the red handle (yellow arrow) on the mirror, drags down the reflection. (c) Dragging the green handle (yellow arrow), changes the position that is reflected at the red point.
