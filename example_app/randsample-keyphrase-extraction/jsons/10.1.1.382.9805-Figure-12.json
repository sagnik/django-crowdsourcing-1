We also consider the SAX based Two-pass\nalgorithm of Section 6, denoted as twoPassSAX, and an implemen-\ntation of transform query in GalaX (which supports XML updates\nand transform queries), denoted by GalaXUpdate. We should re-\nmark that Qizx supports neither updates nor transform queries.\nBased on the benchmark queries of XMark [24], we designed 10\ninsertion transform queries, which differ only in the XPath expres-\nsions used to select the target nodes. The embedded XPath expres-\nsions are shown in Fig. 11. In transform queries U1-U3, the paths\ncontain at most one simple qualifier and no descendant axis. Trans-\nform queries U4 and U5 have descendant axis, U6 has a long path,\nU7 and U8 have a relatively complicated qualifier, and transform\nqueries U9 and U10 contain both descendant axis and qualifiers.\nFigure 12 shows the running time of each of the five methods for\nevaluating transform queries, for U1-U10, using the dataset of size\n2.22M. As shown in this figure, twoPassSAX performs the best in\nall five methods while GENTOP usually runs the fastest among the\nthree algorithm implemented on top of Qizx. Both twoPassSAX\nand GENTOP outperform the GalaXUpdate.\nWhile NAIVE does reasonably well on U2-U3, U6 and U10, it\nfares worse on queries when the set of selected nodes is large\n(i.e., when |$xp| in Fig. 2 is large), as expected. For example, in\nU2, NAIVE performs well due to |$xp| = 1 while its performance\ndeteriorates greatly in U1 since $xp is the set of all persons in the\nXML file. The Top Down method improves on NAIVE since they\nuse the NFA to prune the search space and avoid the lookup in $xp.\nTD-BU handles qualifiers with algorithm bottomUp while the\nother two methods on top of XQuery engines utilize the native pro-\ncessing ability of Qizx. As shown in these figures, although TD-\nBU pays a price for implementing the complexity of bottomUp on\ntop of XQuery, TD-BU is usually comparable with GENTOP when\nthe qualifiers are relatively simple, e.g., in U1-U6.
