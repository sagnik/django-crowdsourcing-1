Both these datasets\nare now publicly distributed at http:\/\/www.seas.upenn.\nedu\/~mdredze\/datasets\/image_spam\/. The SpamArchive\nCollection consists of 13621 ﬁles, out of which only 10623\nare in image format. The other ﬁles are unreadable by\nimage processors; this is due to deliberate manipulation\nby spammers to use other alternatives of image for e-mail\nspam. The Personal spam collection consists of 3300 images.\nIn addition, we have also used the Princeton Image Spam\nBenchmark4 which contains 1071 images with category\ninformation. The utility of this dataset is that each category\ncontains permutations of the same base I-spam template\n(See Fig. 6).\nBaseline: For the sake of comparison, we use the same\ndatasets used previously by other researchers. In particular,\nwe use the approach for testing as used by Dredze et al. since\ntheir results are the best reported so far in comparison to\nother work. The above presented algorithms are compared\nin identical conditions as in the experiments in [5]. OCR\nresults using Open Source Tesseract are also provided for\ncomparison.\n4.1 Results\nWe ﬁrst discuss the more general approach of binary\nclassiﬁcation using visual features. We use our homegrown\n","images to 100 × 100 pixels; this simple mechanism makes\nour method robust to random pixels, simple translation\nand scaling. It also helps greatly with computational\nrequirements as texture and shape extraction are time\nconsuming non-linear routines. We then extract features\nfrom all the images from the positive and negative test set.\nA fraction α of the images are used for training the classiﬁer\nbased on SVMlight while the tests are then carried out on\nthe remaining (1-α) fraction of images. Fig. 4 reports the\nprediction accuracy over the positive and negative set as\nfunction of α.\nWe observe that visual features are highly indicative of\nspam images; our method reports a prediction accuracy of\nover 95% in all cases. Even with large sets of over 15, 000\nemails with only 10% data used for training, the prediction\naccuracy is higher than best numbers reported by [5, 6]. At\na comparable fraction of training\/test set as used by Dredze\net al., we achieved almost 98% accuracy, an improvement\nof over 6%. With the Personal spam dataset, we achieve\ncomparable results as [5].\nWe also investigated the impact of resolution on our\napproach; in particular we are interested to know if lower\nresolutions can provide similar results at a cheaper compu-\ntationally cost. Fig. 3 shows the results of this evaluation;\nwe notice small losses at lower resolutions and small gains\nat higher resolutions. At 400 × 400, the approach is near\n"],"Page":7,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,325,772,396],"Height":1162,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[442,75,751,303]}
