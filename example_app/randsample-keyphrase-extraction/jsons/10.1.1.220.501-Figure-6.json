{"Caption":"Figure 6. Comparison between results from a specular and glossy surface. The left image shows the result of capturing a glossy plas- tic surface. In the right image, the same surface was acquired after having applied a fine layer of oil in order to increase specularity. If the surface is more specular, finer normal variations are detected, whereas the glossy version looks more quantized. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Glossiness Our method becomes less accurate for glossier\n(or rougher) materials. This is visually demonstrated in\nFig. 6 and verified on a ground thruth comparison in Fig. 7.\nFor the latter figure, we generated images of a mesostruc-\nture using a photorealistic renderer (PBRT, [25]) under\nour Gray-coded illumination patterns. We employed a\nphysically-based reflectance model [33], which allows for\ncontrolling the glossiness. Notice how the error increases\nonly slightly for more gloss. Including interpolated normals\nof less confident pixels tend to add an overal increase to the\nnumerical error. Fortunately, the interpolation tends to pro-\nduce smooth results, and thus does not introduce visually\ndistracting artifacts.\nThe reason why glossier materials result in less accurate\nnormal maps is illustrated in Fig. 8. It shows how Gray\ncodes are interpreted for a very specular material (narrow\nspecular lobe) and for a more glossy object (broader lobe).\nAs the Gray code patterns become more refined, it becomes\n","harder to distinguish between the black and white parts of\nthe pattern, which limits the attainable angular sampling\nrate. We therefore stop refinement when the sum of ab-\nsolute differences (SAD) between consecutive refinements\ndrops below a threshold. Even if a material is glossy, we can\nstill infer a reasonable normal map, albeit with less angular\ndetail (Fig. 6,Fig. 7).\n"],"Page":4,"Number":6,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[427,237,757,326],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[427,99,759,234]}
