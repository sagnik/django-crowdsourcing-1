{"Caption":"Figure 3: IPLoM Step-3: Partition by search for bijection. ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["In the third and final partitioning step, we partition by\nsearching for bijective relationships between the set of unique\ntokens in two token positions selected using a criterion de-\nscribed in detail in Algorithm 2. A summary of the heuristic\nwould be to select the first two token positions with the most\nfrequently occuring token count value greater than 1. A bi-\njective function is a 1-1 relation that is both injective and\nsurjective. When a bijection exists between two elements in\nthe sets of tokens, this usually implies that a strong relation-\nship exists between them and log messages that have these\ntoken values in the corresponding token positions are sepa-\nrated into a new partition. Sometimes the relations found\nare not 1-1 but 1-M, M-1 and M-M. In the example given\nin Fig. 3 the tokens Failed and on: have a 1-1 relationship\nbecause all lines that contain the token Failed in position\n2 also contain the token on: in position 3 and vice versa.\nOn the other hand token has has a 1-M relationship with\ntokens completed and been as all lines that contain the token\nhas in position 2 contains either tokens completed or been in\nposition 3, a M-1 relationship will be the reverse of this sce-\nnario. To illustrate a M-M relationship, consider the event\nmessages given below with positions 3 and 4 chosen using\nour heuristic.\n"],"Page":4,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[438,340,772,368],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[475,87,738,297]}
