In both conditions, \nthe typical flow of work during the discussion activity \ninvolved one student explaining the concept to their partner. \nWe categorized the way in which students used the paper \nand digital mediums during discussion: all verbal (no \nannotations made), sketching, written words, or both \nsketching and writing. As summarized in Figure 5, students \nin the digital condition used sketching most often (65% of \nthe time) while students given paper handouts were more \nvaried in the techniques used to support discussion. \n"],"Page":6,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[83,613,400,629],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[90,438,393,607]}
