The working\nset size (WSS) for a GCed application is determined al-\nmost entirely by what happens during full collections, be-\ncause full collections touch every reachable heap object.\nSince live and dead objects are generally mixed together,\nthe working set includes all heap pages used for allocated\nobjects. It also includes the space needed for copied sur-\nvivors of copying regions. Thus, each non-copying region\ncontributes its size to the working set, while each copying\nregion adds its size plus the volume of copied survivors,\nwhich can be as much as the size of the copying region in\nthe worst case.\nSeveral properties of GCed applications are impor-\ntant here. First, given adequate real memory, perfor-\nmance varies with heap size. For example, Figure 3\ndepicts the effect of different amounts of memory (the\nsize of the garbage-collected heap) on performance.
