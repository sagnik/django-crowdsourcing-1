{"Caption":"Figure 7: Embossing motion captured cloth. Notice that the multiresolution result (left) is free from the \u201Ccrumpling\u201D artifacts present in the single resolution result (right). ","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Blockification greatly accelerates basis smoothing, since smoothing\nneed only be performed near block boundaries. For example, on the\ncollapsing horse sequence (Figure 10), blockified basis smoothing\nwith a window consisting of 19 frames was performed using an\naverage of only 3.5 bases. On sequences with less drastic deforma-\ntion, the speedup is even greater. Blockified basis smoothing with a\n19 frame window on the motion captured cloth sequence (Figure 1)\nused only 1.7 bases per frame (more than 11 times faster than reg-\nular basis smoothing). We typically use a threshold of nearly zero\n(1×10−6), and block sizes are typically on the order of 10 frames\nper block.\n","capture and then subdivided with two levels of Loop subdivision.\nFigure 7 shows both multiresolution and single resolution emboss-\ning of the word \u201CHI\u201D into the cloth.
