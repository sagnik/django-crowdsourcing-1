of JavaScript sizes in France, and we show CDFs of CSS\nsizes in China in Figure 5 (b), from 2006 to 2010. We omit the\nsimilar results of other countries due to space constraints. The in-\ncreased code size of JavaScript and advanced CSS is likely related\nto the increasing popularity of Ajax. In general, other content types\ndo not show consistent size changes over time.\nWhile there seems to be no significant size changes over time in\nvideo objects, we observe FLV objects are bigger than other video\nin general. Figure 5 (c) compares the object size (CDF) of differ-\nent video types in the United States for 2010. Some video objects\n(e.g., ASF) are very small in size and they are container objects\nthat do not contain actual video content. Once users fetch this kind\nof container object, they contact media streaming servers that use\nnon-HTTP protocols such as RTSP [55] or RTP [54] for fetching\nthe content. The median size of such container objects is typically\nless than 1 KB, while that of FLV, WMV, and MPEG is 1743 KB,\n265 KB, and 802 KB, respectively.\nFinally, while new video streaming technologies that split a large\nvideo file into multiple smaller files for cacheability and perfor-\nmance started gaining popularity in late 2009 and 2010 [1, 8, 41],\nwe do not see its wide deployment in our data set yet. With these\nnew technologies, we expect to observe a decrease in size of video\nobjects with an increasing number of requests. We plan to analyze\nthis case with more recent data set in the future.\n","Object Size We find that the size of JavaScript and CSS to be in-\ncreasing steadily over time. As an example, Figure 5 (a) presents\n","(a) FR: JavaScript (b) CN: CSS (c) US, 2010: video\nFigure 5: Object size: The object size of JavaScript and CSS becomes larger. Flash video is bigger than other video.\n","we observe a consistent increase of the number of objects and the\ntotal size in Figure 9 (b) and (c). For example, the median number\nof objects per page in the United States sees an increase from 6\nobjects in 2006 to 12 objects in 2010, and the median page size\ngets bigger from 69 KB in 2006 to 133 KB in 2010. This increase\nis likely related to the popular use of advertisement\/analytics, and\nthe object size increase of JavaScript and CSS in Figure 5 (a) and\n(b).\n","Impact of Content Types Among many different content types,\nwe find that text resources such as HTML, JavaScript, XML, and\nCSS have much higher redundancy than binary resources such as\nimage, audio, video, and octet-stream. Figure 15 shows the ideal\nredundancy by content type. In particular, JavaScript shows over\n90% of redundancy with the smallest chunk size of 128 bytes. On\nthe other hand, video exhibits much lower redundancy of 20%,\nillustrating the impact of long-tailed popularity in video content.\nObject-based caching performs very poorly, and its redundancy\nelimination for XML is one-eighth that of the gains with 128 byte\nchunks in China.\nWe also find that content-based caching works well regardless of\nthe content types, while the object-based caching is mainly effec-\ntive for JavaScript and image traffic only. Figure 16 depicts the con-\ntribution of byte savings, basically showing which caching scheme\nworks best for which content type. In object-based caching, the\ncontribution of JavaScript and image is relatively larger than that of\nother content types. It should be noted that the contribution of bi-\nnary resources such as video, audio, and octet-stream is extremely\nlow, implying that object-based caching is not suitable for them.\nOn the other hand, content-based caching provides more uniform\nbenefits.\n","(a) US (b) CN\nFigure 15: Ideal redundancy by content types: Text resources have higher redundancy than binary.\n","first option is to discard and do not cache them, but it just wastes the\nbandwidth and reduces cache hit rate. The second option is to fully\ndownload and cache them (of course, for those cacheable objects\nonly), but it consumes significant bandwidth for downloading ob-\njects that might not be referenced in the future. The third option lies\nin between the first and second, and decides whether to discard or\nfully download depending on the number of bytes remaining [58].\nThe final option is to cache the downloaded portion and do a range\nrequest on a cache hit, but it is effective only for cacheable objects.\nIn comparison, content-based caching could cache data from only\nthe downloaded content without any configuration, thus any data\nreceived over network, even uncacheable, is useful. As evidence,\ncontent-based caching\u2019s byte hit rate of video traffic is much higher\nthan object- based caching\u2019s byte hit rate in Figure 15.\n"],"Page":5,"Number":5,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[115,250,729,263],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[100,80,740,244]}
