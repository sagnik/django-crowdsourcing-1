We pose two questions: first, what portion of profile vis-\nitors are repeat visitors? Second, are visitors mostly friends of the\nprofile owner, or are they unrelated strangers?\nWe begin by addressing the first question. We calculate the per-\ncentage of repeated visitors for each profile, and report the distri-\nbution in Figure 12. Roughly 70% of users have less than 50%\nrepeat visitors, meaning that the majority of visitors do not browse\nthe same profile twice. This seems to indicate the long tail of la-\ntent interactions is generated by users randomly browsing the social\ngraph.\nNext, we take a closer look at repeat profile visits. Figure 13\nshows the probability density function (PDF) of the interval time\nbetween repeat visits. The graph peaks on day 0, meaning that\nusers are most likely to return to a viewed profile on the same day.\nWe will examine the causes for this behavior more closely in Sec-\n"],"Page":7,"Number":13,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[98,507,381,521],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[94,311,397,490]}
