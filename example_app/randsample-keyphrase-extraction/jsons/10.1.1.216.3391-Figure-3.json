We did this after 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1024 judgments.\nTo compare rankings we use a rank correlation measure\ncalled Kendall\u2019s tau [6]. Kendall\u2019s tau is calculated using\npairwise inversions between elements in two lists. It ranges\nfrom -1 to 1, with -1 indicating that the two lists are re-\nversed, 0 that half the pairs of elements are inverted, and 1\nthat the two lists are identical. Since we have only 8 systems,\nthe range of values is limited.\nThe result is shown in Figure 3. We see that the correla-\ntion between EMAP and true MAP increases very fast; after\nonly 32 judgments it is about .85. It takes regular MAP 256\njudgments to get to the same point.\nThe bpref metric also uses nonrelevance information [2].\nThis result tracks with bpref.\n"],"Page":6,"Number":3,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[73,312,407,385],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[78,80,386,298]}
