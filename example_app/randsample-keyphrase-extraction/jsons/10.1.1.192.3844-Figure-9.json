Figure 9 shows the fraction of ASes\nof each AS type that were registered to ARIN (North America) and\nRIPE (mostly Europe). The other registries (APNIC, LACNIC and\nAFRINIC) account for the remaining small fraction, and are not\nshown here. Interestingly, we see that the population of ECs in the\ntwo continents (NA and Europe) converges. It is likely that in the\nnext few years there will be more ECs registered in Europe than in\nNorth America. This has already happened in the case of STPs, and\nthe number of STPs is now slightly higher in Europe. LTPs, though,\nare mostly still based in North America. On the other hand, the\nfraction of CAHPs in Europe has always been higher than in North\nAmerica, probably because of the many regional access providers\n(several per country) in Europe. These trends imply that the In-\nternet market, in terms of the number of access\/hosting, transit and\ncontent providers will soon be larger in Europe than in North Amer-\nica, if this is not happening already.\nRewiring activity for each AS type: The differences in the busi-\nness function and incentives of the four AS types could also appear\nin their rewiring activity. To measure this quantity between a pair\nof snapshots, we calculate the Jaccard distance for the set of CP\nlinks of each AS.We then compute the average Jaccard distance for\nall ASes of the same AS type. The top panel of Figure 10 shows\nthese averages over time. We see that, clearly, ECs show the lowest\n","ness and repulsiveness time series at a particular lag. We \u0002nd 317\nproviders for which a signi\u0002cant correlation exists at some lag. For\neach of those providers, we then determine the lag that shows the\nmaximum absolute correlation.\nFigure 19 shows, for the previous 317 providers, the lag at which\nthe maximum (in absolute value) correlation occurred. Interest-\ningly, we \u0002nd that in almost all cases the correlation is positive.\nFurther, we \u0002nd that in 85% of the cases, the maximum correlation\noccurs at positive lags. In particular, most of the mass is at lags\n1, 2 and 3 snapshots (44.7%, 13.5% and 9.1% of the providers,\nrespectively). Note that a positive lag l means that we correlate\nthe attractiveness at time t with the repulsiveness at time t + l,\nand each lag corresponds to 3 months. So, for a large number of\nproviders, strong attractiveness precedes strong repulsiveness by a\nperiod of 3-9 months. There are several possible reasons for this\neffect. We conjecture that some providers attract many new cus-\ntomers due to advertising and promotions. These providers are not\nalways able to keep their new customers, leading to signi\u0002cant re-\npulsiveness a few months later. This may be due to customers that\nchange providers frequently (such as CAHPs), or due to follow-up\nadvertising\/promotions from competitors.\n"],"Page":8,"Number":9,"Type":"Figure","CaptionBB":[96,591,383,604],"Height":1100,"Width":850,"DPI":100,"ImageBB":[89,358,388,567]}
