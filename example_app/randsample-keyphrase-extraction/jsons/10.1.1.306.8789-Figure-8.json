Figure 8 in turn varies the number of servers\nwhile maintaining a static set of 640 clients. At smaller\ngroup sizes, additional servers do not benefit performance.\nAs demands on the servers scale, however, their utility\nbecomes more apparent, especially in the 128K message\nscenario. Performance appears to be dominated by client\ndelays, namely the time between clients receiving the\nprevious round\u2019s cleartext and the servers receiving the\ncurrent round\u2019s ciphertext message. However, in compar-\ning the PlanetLab evaluation to the DeterLab evaluation\nand server size of 1, we can ascertain that latency be-\ntween servers tends to dominate delays in that environ-\nment, though computational load is not negligible.\nThe prototype shows greatest usability for group sizes\nup to 1,000; thereafter delays become longer than 1 sec-\nond in the microblogging scenario. At best, delays were\non the order of 500 to 600 ms for 32 to 256 clients. In\nthe static client network, varying server count, showed\ntime increases on server-related aspects of the protocol\nbut reduced time on client-related aspects. We therefore\nexpect that with greater demand\u2014either in terms of nodes\nor bandwidth\u2014client-related costs are likely to dominate.\nIn comparing the microblogging and 128K message\nscenarios, the graphs suggest that bandwidth tends to\ndominate for larger messages and latency for smaller\nmessages.
