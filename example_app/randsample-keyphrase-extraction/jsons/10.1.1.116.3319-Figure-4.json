{"Caption":"Figure 4: Provider VPN","ImageText":[],"Mention":["Enterprise networks are increasingly using provider-\nbased Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to connect ge-\nographically disparate sites. In such a VPN, each cus-\ntomer site has one or more customer edge (CE) router\nconnecting to a one or more provider edge (PE) routers\nin the provider network (see Figure 4). Incoming cus-\ntomer traffic from a CE is encapsulated at the PE and car-\nried across the provider network, decapsulated by a re-\nmote provider edge router and handed off to the customer\nCE router at a remote site of the same customer. Traf-\nfic belonging to different customers is segregated in the\nprovider backbone, and the provider network is opaque\nto the customer. The predominant method for supporting\nprovider-based VPNs uses MPLS as the encapsulating\ntechnology across the provider backbone.\nFrom a provider perspective, a critical part of sup-\nporting the VPN service involves configuring the the CE\nrouters. The tasks include configuring ACLs, interfaces,\nWAN (Wide Area Network) and LAN (Local Area Net-\nwork) links and routing (e.g., OSPF and BGP) . The key\nchallenges pertain to heterogeneity and scale. VPN ser-\nvices enjoy a large and growing number of customers. A\nsingle customer can have hundreds to thousands of dif-\nferent sites.
